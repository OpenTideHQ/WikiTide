## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Attacker may change critical files on Unix-like systems,
> 
> * shell initialisation and configuration, such as:
>   - `/etc/profile`, `/etc/shells`, `/etc/profile.d/*`, `/etc/bash.bashrc`, 
>   `/etc/bashrc`, `/etc/zsh/zprofile`, `/etc/zsh/zshrc`, `/etc/zsh/zlogin`, 
>   `/etc/zsh/zlogout`, `/etc/csh.cshrc`, `/etc/csh.login`,
> * as well as root-owned configuration files, such as:
>   * `/root/.bashrc`, `/root/.bash_profile`, `/root/.profile`, `/root/.zshrc`, 
>   `/root/.zprofile`
> * and user-specific files, such as:
>   * `/home/*/.bashrc`, `/home/*/.zshrc`, `/home/*/.bash_profile`, 
>   `/home/*/.zprofile`, `/home/*/.profile`, `/home/*/.bash_login`, 
>   `/home/*/.bash_logout`, `/home/*/.zlogin`, `/home/*/.zlogout`
> 
> These files are typically executed whenever a user logs in or spawns a new 
> shell session. By manipulating these files, attackers may:
> 
> 1. **Introduce malicious code** by modifying the configuration files with 
> the objective of dropping malware to the compromised system, such as 
> Backdoors or Trojans.
> 2. **Alter system settings**: Changes to the configuration files can modify 
> system settings, such as environment variables, PATH variables, or other 
> critical settings, which can compromise the system's security and integrity.
> 3. **Disable security features** such as audit logging or access controls, 
> to evade detection or gain unauthorized access to the system.
> 4. **Create unauthorized access**: Modifications to the configuration files 
> can create unauthorized access points, such as adding new users or modifying 
> existing user accounts.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversary must have the ability to modify or replace shell configuration files 
> (e.g., .bashrc, .profile) through existing privileges or successful elevation 
> of privileges on the target host.

| TeamTNT                | In early Febuary, 2021 TeamTNT launched a new campaign against Docker and Kubernetes environments. Using a collection of container images that are hosted in Docker Hub, the attackers are targeting misconfigured docker daemons, Kubeflow dashboards, and Weave Scope, exploiting these environments in order to steal cloud credentials, open backdoors, mine cryptocurrency, and launch a worm that is looking for the next victim.They're linked to the First Crypto-Mining Worm to Steal AWS Credentials and Hildegard Cryptojacking malware.TeamTNT is a relatively recent addition to a growing number of threats targeting the cloud. While they employ some of the same tactics as similar groups, TeamTNT stands out with their social media presence and penchant for self-promotion.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîê Persistence`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Linux` : Placeholder
 - ` macOS` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`üîÑ Log tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Log tampering or modification
 - [`üîê New Accounts`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Ability to create new arbitrary user accounts.
 - [`üíÖ Modify privileges`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify privileges or permissions
 - [`‚ú® Modify data`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify stored data or content

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
