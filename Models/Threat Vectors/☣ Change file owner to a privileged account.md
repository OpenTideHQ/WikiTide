## 👁️ Description

> Adversaries seeking to gain or maintain elevated privileges often target the 
> ownership and permissions of critical files or directories. By changing a 
> file’s owner to a privileged account (e.g., SYSTEM on Windows, `root` on Linux, 
> or `root:wheel` on macOS), threat actors ensure that their malicious tools, 
> binaries, or configuration files inherit elevated trust levels. 
> This manipulation can facilitate various malicious objectives, including 
> executing code with higher privileges, bypassing security controls, 
> and evading detection.  
> 
> ### Windows
> 
> Attackers may use built-in utilities such as `takeown.exe` or `icacls.exe` 
> to change ownership and grant Full Control permissions to a high-privilege 
> user or group.  
> 
> For instance:  
> ```powershell
> takeown.exe /f C:\sensitive_data.txt
> icacls.exe C:\sensitive_data.txt /setowner Administrator
> icacls.exe C:\sensitive_data.txt /grant Administrator:F
> ```
> 
> By doing so, they can ensure that subsequent manipulations of these files, 
> including the addition of backdoors, data exfiltration tools, 
> or credential-stealing binaries, are executed under a privileged context.  
> 
> ### Linux and macOS
> 
> Threat actors mainly rely on the `chown` command to modify file ownership. 
> But other commands may achieve the same objective like chgrp or setfacl 
> 
> For example:
> ```bash
> sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/malicious_script
> ```
> 
> Once a file is owned by `root`, it can be paired with setuid bits 
> or extended attributes, enabling the file to run with elevated privileges. 
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > The adversary must have sufficient privileges (e.g., local administrator 
> or root permissions) on the target host or domain controller to modify 
> file ownership attributes.

| UNC1878             | UNC1878 is a financially motivated threat actor that monetizes network access via the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Earlier this year, Mandiant published a blog on a fast-moving adversary deploying RYUK ransomware, UNC1878. Shortly after its release, there was a significant decrease in observed UNC1878 intrusions and RYUK activity overall almost completely vanishing over the summer. But beginning in early fall, Mandiant has seen a resurgence of RYUK along with TTP overlaps indicating that UNC1878 has returned from the grave and resumed their operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                    | 🌌 MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`💅 Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`💅 Modify privileges`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify privileges or permissions
 - [`🐒 Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`🥸 Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`🌍 Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`🛑 Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
