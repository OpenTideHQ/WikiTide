## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Typosquatting, also known as URL hijacking, is a form of cyber attack
> where an attacker registers a domain name that is very similar to a
> legitimate and popular website, often by exploiting common typing
> errors or misspellings. This is done to deceive users into visiting
> the fake domain, usually with the intention of spreading disinformation,
> stealing personal information, or installing malware ref [1].  
> 
> In the context of disinformation, typosquatting can be used to create
> a fake version of a trusted news source or government website in order
> to spread false or misleading information. By exploiting users' trust
> in familiar domain names, attackers can manipulate public opinion,
> confusion, and undermine the credibility of legitimate sources.  
> 
> Threat actors can impersonate domains in different ways.
> 
> Some of them are:
> 
> - A common misspelling of the target domain (example: CSOnline.com rather than CSOOnline.com)
> - A different top-level domain (example: using .uk rather than .co.uk)
> - Combining related words into the domain (CSOOnline-Cybersecurity.com)
> - Adding periods to the URL (CSO.Online.com)
> - Using similar looking letters to hide the false domain (√áS√ìOnlin√©.com)
> 
> Typosquatting is a lookalike domain with one or two wrong or different
> characters with the aim of trying to trick people onto the wrong webpage.
> 
> The threat actors can buy and use a domain only with a little change
> compared to the legitimate and official site of some service.
> It can be difficult for the end user to recognise the difference, for
> example between goggle.com and google.com or google.com written with
> similar character for the character "o" but actually from different
> UTF encoding system. It can looks like a well known and legit
> domain but to be actually a malicious one with a very close name.
> 
> In some of the cases regarding the security reports typosquatting
> domain attack is used in malicious campaigns for disinformation.
> For example, Doppelganger is a pro-Russian misleading information
> operation targeting the European Union (EU) and other geopolitical
> actors. This campaign exploits political, economic, and social
> divisions within the EU and its member states. 
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > A threat actor use vulnerabilities in domain providers to buy similar
> to a legit domain and to use them for malicious purposes.
> 
> Usually the threat actors are buying as much as possible domains
> on a bulk with impersonation goal, social engineering or just spreading
> disinformation.

| Lazarus Group      | Since 2009, HIDDEN COBRA actors have leveraged their capabilities to target and compromise a range of victims; some intrusions have resulted in the exfiltration of data while others have been disruptive in nature. Commercial reporting has referred to this activity as Lazarus Group and Guardians of Peace. Tools and capabilities used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include DDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and wiper malware. Variants of malware and tools used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include Destover, Duuzer, and Hangman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Operation DarkSeoul, Dark Seoul, Hidden Cobra, Hastati Group, Andariel, Unit 121, Bureau 121, NewRomanic Cyber Army Team, Bluenoroff, Subgroup: Bluenoroff, Group 77, Labyrinth Chollima, Operation Troy, Operation GhostSecret, Operation AppleJeus, APT38, APT 38, Stardust Chollima, Whois Hacking Team, Zinc, Appleworm, Nickel Academy, APT-C-26, NICKEL GLADSTONE, COVELLITE, ATK3, G0032, ATK117, G0082, Citrine Sleet, DEV-0139, DEV-1222, Diamond Sleet, ZINC, Sapphire Sleet, COPERNICIUM, TA404, Lazarus group, BeagleBoyz, Moonstone Sleet | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `üì± Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.
 - `ü¶æ IoT` : Placeholder
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üë§ Customer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Customer
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üìß Email Platform`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [` Other`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Media - Other/Unknown
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Linux` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`ü¶π Asset and fraud`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Asset and fraud-related losses
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
