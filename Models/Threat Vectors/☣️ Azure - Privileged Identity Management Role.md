## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> The threat vector describes the risk that an adversary may escalate privileges by 
> abusing Privileged Identity Management (PIM) assignments or role activation features 
> within Azure Active Directory. PIM is designed to provide just-in-time and approval-based 
> access to highly privileged roles (e.g., Global Administrator, Owner), instead of 
> permanent assignment. However, if misconfigured or insufficiently monitored, PIM 
> itself can become an avenue for privilege escalation attacks.
> 
> ### Example Attack Scenario
> 
> An attacker gains access to a regular Azure AD user account that is configured as 
> eligible for privileged role activation (such as Global Administrator) through PIM. 
> The attacker then activates the privileged role via Azure AD PIM, immediately acquiring 
> elevated permissions. This could be done by interacting with Azure Graph API endpoints 
> to trigger role eligibility schedules and activations, such as:
> 
> - `GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/roleManagement/directory/roleEligibilitySchedules/{id}`
> - `GET https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleEligibilityScheduleRequests/{roleEligibilityScheduleRequestName}?api-version=2020-10-01`
> 
> The attacker uses the newly gained privileges to:
> - Add themselves or an accomplice as a permanent or eligible member for other privileged roles.
> - Carry out further attacks with escalated access.[1]
> 
> ### Attack Goals and Impact
> 
> The main goals of abusing a PIM role assignment include:
> - **Persistence:** Staying undetected with elevated privileges for longer periods.
> - **Privilege Escalation:** Obtaining admin-level access across Azure AD and resources.
> - **Manipulation and Control:** Modifying security controls, configurations, or resource 
> access to facilitate lateral movement, data theft, or additional attacks.[3][1]
> - **Data Breach and Resource Manipulation:** Exfiltration of sensitive data or disruption 
> of critical services.
> 
> The impact can include unauthorized administrative actions, permanent backdoors 
> via modified role assignments, data breaches, and complete compromise of the Azure environment.[4][3][1]
> 
> ### Attack Flow and Methodology
> 
> 1. **Reconnaissance:** Identify eligible users or accounts for PIM role activation 
> in Azure AD or resources.
> 2. **Initial Access:** Gain credentials for a user account eligible for PIM role activation.
> 3. **Activation:** Use Azure AD PIM to activate the privileged role temporarily 
> or request permanent assignment, triggering privileges using documented APIs and management endpoints.
> 4. **Escalation and Manipulation:** Once privileges are obtained:
>     - Add or change eligible members in PIM.
>     - Modify resource permissions (via `RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory`).
>     - Abuse elevated access, e.g., create, delete, or alter resources and audit logs.
> 5. **Persistence:** Maintain administrative access by adding themselves as eligible 
> members or scheduling future eligibility.
> 6. **Detection Evasion:** Exploit gaps in logging or monitoring or tamper with audit 
> logs if possible.

| APT29                     | A 2015 report by F-Secure describe APT29 as: 'The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. The Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States;Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments;organizations associated with Chechen extremism;and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large - scale spear - phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash - and - grab approach involving a fast but noisy breakin followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible.If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long - term intelligence gathering. This threat actor targets government ministries and agencies in the West, Central Asia, East Africa, and the Middle East; Chechen extremist groups; Russian organized crime; and think tanks. It is suspected to be behind the 2015 compromise of unclassified networks at the White House, Department of State, Pentagon, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The threat actor includes all of the Dukes tool sets, including MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, SeaDuke, CloudDuke (aka MiniDionis), and HammerDuke (aka Hammertoss).

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`ü•∏ Privilege Escalation`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : The result of techniques that provide an attacker with higher permissions on a system or network.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üë§ Identity Services`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üß© API Endpoints`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Portal`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üõ†Ô∏è Virtual Machines`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`‚òÅÔ∏è IaaS`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Azure` : Placeholder
 - ` Azure AD` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`üíÖ Modify privileges`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify privileges or permissions

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
