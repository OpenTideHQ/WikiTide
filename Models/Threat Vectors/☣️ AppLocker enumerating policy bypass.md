## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Enumerating policy bypass in AppLocker refers to the process of identifying
> and exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities in AppLocker policies to run
> unauthorised applications.    
> 
> A threat actor can use various methods and tools to enumerate AppLocker
> policies with the goal to find weaknesses in this protection mechanism and
> to exploit its whitelisting. Some of them are listed below.
> 
> ### Bypass AppLocker policies
> 
> - Renaming executables method - renaming malicious executables to match the
> name of an allowed application. In this way a threat actor can hide their
> real malicious executables and intend in order to bypass AppLocker policies. 
> - Using alternative executable extensions - using alternative executable
> extensions, such as .scr or .pif, to bypass AppLocker rules.
> - Enumeration of AppLocker policies tools - a threat actor can use different
> enumeration tools to check if AppLocker policies are on place and what they
> are blocking.
> 
> ### Enumerating AppLocker policies
> 
> AppLocker policies can be enumerated using the registry query functionality,
> as show below ref [5],[6]:  
> 
> 'reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\SrpV2\'
> 
> ### Known tools for AppLocker policy enumeration
> 
> AppLocker is a Windows feature that allows administrators to control which
> applications can run on a device. Threat actors often try to bypass or
> enumerate AppLocker policies to execute malicious code.
> 
> - PowerShell: PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used to enumerate
> AppLocker policies. Threat actors can use PowerShell cmdlets like
> `Get-AppLockerPolicy` to retrieve AppLocker policies and
> `Test-AppLockerPolicy` to test whether a specific application is allowed
> to run.
> - AppLocker Bypass Tools: There are several tools available online that can
> bypass AppLocker policies. For example, the tool named `AppLockerBypass` is
> a tool that uses various techniques to bypass AppLocker policies. Another
> tool used for this purpose is `BypassAppLocker`. This tool uses PowerShell
> to bypass AppLocker policies.
> - MSBuild: MSBuild is a legitimate Windows utility that can be used to build
> and execute code. Threat actors can use MSBuild to bypass AppLocker policies
> by executing malicious code.
> - Rundll32 : RunDLL is a legitimate Windows utility that can be used to execute
> dll. Threat actors can use RunDLL to bypass AppLocker policies.
> - Regasm/Regsvr32: Regasm and Regsvr32 are legitimate Windows utilities that
> can be used to register and execute DLLs. Threat actors can use these tools
> to bypass AppLocker policies by executing malicious DLLs.
> - Certutil: Certutil is a legitimate Windows utility that can be used to
> manage certificates. Threat actors can use Certutil to bypass AppLocker
> policies by executing malicious code.
> - Wscript/Cscript: Wscript and Cscript are legitimate Windows utilities that
> can be used to execute scripts. Threat actors can use these tools to bypass
> AppLocker policies by executing malicious scripts.
> - Invoke-AppLockerBypass: This is a PowerShell script that uses various
> techniques to bypass AppLocker policies.
> - SharpAppLocker: This is a C# tool that can be used to bypass AppLocker
> policies.
> - WinPEAS - WinPEAS is a powerful tool that can be used to audit and bypass
> Windows security features, including AppLocker policies. For more details
> related to WinPEAS Applocker enumeration usage check ref [2].  
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > A threat actor needs to have sufficient privileges to enumerate AppLocker
> policies and initial access to the targeted system. 
> 
> Required level of privileges to enumerate SharpAppLocker could be one of
> the listed below:
> 
> - Local Administrator or elevated privileges
> - Access to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) or Windows Registry
> - Ability to execute PowerShell scripts or commands
>

| APT29              | A 2015 report by F-Secure describe APT29 as: 'The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. The Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States;Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments;organizations associated with Chechen extremism;and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large - scale spear - phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash - and - grab approach involving a fast but noisy breakin followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible.If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long - term intelligence gathering. This threat actor targets government ministries and agencies in the West, Central Asia, East Africa, and the Middle East; Chechen extremist groups; Russian organized crime; and think tanks. It is suspected to be behind the 2015 compromise of unclassified networks at the White House, Department of State, Pentagon, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The threat actor includes all of the Dukes tool sets, including MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, SeaDuke, CloudDuke (aka MiniDionis), and HammerDuke (aka Hammertoss).

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üèÉüèΩ Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üë§ Customer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Customer
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [` Other`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Media - Other/Unknown

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Windows` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`ü§¨ Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
