## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> This threat vector focuses on the malicious use of the `LD_PRELOAD` environment 
> variable on Linux systems to hook or hijack library function calls. Attackers, 
> Red Teams, and advanced persistent threats leverage this trick to intercept and 
> modify the behavior of dynamically linked libraries before the legitimate 
> functions are called. By loading a rogue or malicious library via `LD_PRELOAD`, 
> adversaries can achieve elevated privileges, persist on the target, and run 
> arbitrary code under the guise of otherwise legitimate processes.    
> 
> Scenario example: 
> - An attacker already possessing local or remote administrative access to a Linux 
> host can set or modify the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable in order to inject 
> custom libraries during program execution.   
> 
> - When an application starts, the system dynamic linker reads the `LD_PRELOAD` variable 
> and forces the loading of the malicious library.  
> 
> - The malicious library intercepts and potentially manipulates function calls‚Äîsuch as 
> file I/O or network operations‚Äîallowing attackers to subvert security controls or 
> execute code of their choice.
> 
> ```bash
> LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/malicious.so /usr/bin/anyApp
> ```
> 
> This indicates that a potentially unauthorized library (`/tmp/malicious.so`) is being 
> force-loaded into `anyApp`.  
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Threat actor must have sufficient privileges to modify environment variables or

| TeamTNT              | In early Febuary, 2021 TeamTNT launched a new campaign against Docker and Kubernetes environments. Using a collection of container images that are hosted in Docker Hub, the attackers are targeting misconfigured docker daemons, Kubeflow dashboards, and Weave Scope, exploiting these environments in order to steal cloud credentials, open backdoors, mine cryptocurrency, and launch a worm that is looking for the next victim.They're linked to the First Crypto-Mining Worm to Steal AWS Credentials and Hildegard Cryptojacking malware.TeamTNT is a relatively recent addition to a growing number of threats targeting the cloud. While they employ some of the same tactics as similar groups, TeamTNT stands out with their social media presence and penchant for self-promotion.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`ü•∏ Privilege Escalation`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : The result of techniques that provide an attacker with higher permissions on a system or network.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

 - [`üìÑ Server Logs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Log or event management

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Linux` : Placeholder
 - ` Docker Engine` : Placeholder
 - ` Kubernetes` : Placeholder

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`üì¶ Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üëΩ Alter behavior`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Influence or alter human behavior

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`üí∏ Monetary Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : The vector will directly conduct to loss of value directly impacting the bottom line.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
