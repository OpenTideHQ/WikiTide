## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> The threat vector involves exploiting emulated environments to bypass security measures, 
> automate malicious activities, and manipulate app behavior. Below are key aspects 
> of this threat:
> 
> ## How the Attack Works
> 1. **Exploitation of Emulators**:
>   - Android emulators like NoxPlayer, BlueStacks, or custom emulator farms are 
>   used by attackers to mimic legitimate devices and bypass app security mechanisms.
>   - Emulators provide attackers with a controlled environment to test and refine 
>   their techniques before deploying them at scale.
> 
> 2. **Fraudulent Activities**:
>   - **Spoofing Device Identifiers**: Attackers use emulators to replicate legitimate 
>   device identifiers (e.g., IMEI, OS version) obtained through malware or phishing 
>   attacks, making fraudulent transactions appear genuine.
>   - **Automation**: Scripts and automation frameworks enable large-scale fraud, 
>   such as creating fake accounts, performing unauthorized transactions, or bypassing 
>   authentication systems.
>   - **Data Manipulation**: Emulators allow attackers to intercept and modify app 
>   data or API calls for malicious purposes.
> 
> 3. **Advanced Techniques**:
>   - **Runtime Hooks**: Tools like Frida are used to hook into app functions dynamically, 
>   altering system properties (e.g., `ro.kernel.qemu`) to make the emulator appear 
>   as a physical device.
>   - **Customized Emulator Farms**: Organized groups deploy emulator farms with 
>   dozens of emulators to cycle through spoofed devices rapidly, avoiding detection 
>   and maximizing fraud efficiency.
> 
> ## Common Attack Scenarios
> - **Financial Fraud**: Emulator farms have been used to steal millions from banks 
> by automating fraudulent transactions while evading detection systems.
> - **API Abuse**: Attackers reverse-engineer apps running on emulators to exploit 
> APIs for unauthorized access or data theft.
> - **App Tampering**: Emulators facilitate code injection or reverse engineering 
> to modify app functionality and compromise security features.
> 
> ## Key Components Used in These Attacks
> - Access to compromised credentials (usernames/passwords) and device identifiers.
> - Custom scripts for network interception and API manipulation.
> - Cycling of spoofed devices to evade detection and maintain operational stealth.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversaries require users to download emulators that have been
> compromised or misconfigured and through these, they can carry
> out malicious activities.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üèÉüèΩ Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üì± Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üì± Mobile phone`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Mobile phone or smartphone
 - [`ü™™ Personal Information`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üì± Tablet`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Tablet

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Android` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`‚ú® Modify data`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify stored data or content
 - [`üì¶ Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`ü¶† Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`üò§ Nuisance`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Small and mostly inconsequential to day to day operations, but noticed.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
