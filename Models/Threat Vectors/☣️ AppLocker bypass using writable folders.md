## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> AppLocker bypass using writable folders is a technique where an attacker
> exploits the fact that AppLocker only checks the executable file's path,
> not the path of the folder containing the executable. By placing a malicious
> executable in a writable folder that is not restricted by AppLocker, an
> attacker can bypass AppLocker controls.  
> 
> AppLocker uses a set of rules to determine which applications are allowed
> to run. These rules are based on factors like the application's path,
> publisher, and hash. If a threat actor can write to a folder that is allowed
> by AppLocker, they can potentially bypass the restrictions.  
> 
> ### Examples for AppLocker writable folders
> 
> The list below includes some of the folders in Windows where a standard user
> have write permissions by default. These permissions can be used by threat
> actors and let them to bypass AppLocker Windows whitelisting functionality.
> For more information please check ref [1], [2].  
> 
> - `C:\Windows\Tasks` - Windows Tasks directory, writable by the "Users" group
> - `C:\Windows\Temp`  - Temporary Files
> - `C:\Windows\tracing`
> - `C:\Windows\Registration\CRMLog`
> - `C:\Windows\System32\FxsTmp`
> - `C:\Windows\System32\com\dmp`
> - `C:\Windows\System32\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys`
> - `C:\Windows\System32\spool\PRINTERS`
> - `C:\Windows\System32\spool\SERVERS`
> - `C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color`
> - `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\SyncCenter`
> - `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks_Migrated`
>    (after peforming a version upgrade of Windows 10)
> - `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\FxsTmp`
> - `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\com\dmp`
> - `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\SyncCenter`
> - `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\PLA\System`
> 
> Additional ref [3], [4]:
> 
> - `%APPDATA%`                        # Application Data / Roaming User Data
> - `%LOCALAPPDATA%`                   # Local Application Data / Local User Data
> - `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop`            # User's Desktop): Desktop
> - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp` # Local Low, this is a subfolder of %LOCALAPPDATA%
> 
> ### Other possible writable folders in AppLocker
> 
> There are some other possible writable folders in `C:\WINDOWS` where a
> standard Windows user may have write permissions by default. For example,
> 'accesschk.exe' from Sysinternals Suite can be used to find folders that
> are writable and can be leveraged. Furthermore, 'icacls.exe' can be used to
> determine if we also have execute rights within the targeted folder.
> 
> Different threat actors are actively exploiting this AppLocker bypass
> technique to deploy malware, execute malicious code, and gain persistence
> on compromised systems.
> 
> ### Example
> 
> Lenovo devices include a file, MFGSTAT.zip, in C:\\Windows that is writable
> by authenticated users. An attacker can embed a malicious payload into an
> NTFS alternate data stream within this ZIP file and invoke it via a signed
> Windows binary (e.g., AppVLP.exe), bypassing AppLocker rules.  
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > A threat actor needs and initial access to a Windows system and user's write
> permissions where AppLocker policies allow execution from common writable
> directories like C:\\Windows\\Temp or Tasks.

## Model Data

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üë§ Customer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Customer

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Windows` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`ü§¨ Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
