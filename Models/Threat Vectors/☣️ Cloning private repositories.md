## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> A threat actor can clone legit repositories, embed malicious code
> but make them looks like legit. Their purpose is to entice a developer
> to download and use the decoy repositories.    
> 
> Unauthorized cloning of private repositories is a form of IP theft.
> Adversaries from external hackers to insiders aim to steal source code,
> configuration details and secrets. The stolen information can be used
> in multiple ways such as competitive advantage, discover vulnerabilities,
> compromise other systems or mimic the original repositories to trick
> developers into their rogue repository.  
> 
> After cloning of the repository, as a next step, the threat actor
> spreads public available links from where a developer downloads its
> malicious content.  
> 
> The threat actors employ various techniques to clone public or private
> repositories, often with malicious intent. Some of the methods for
> repository cloning include:  
> 
> ### Misconfigured GitHub repositories
> 
> Threat actors exploit misconfigurations in GitHub, Gitlab or similar
> repositories. They search for repositories with sensitive information
> (such as API keys, credentials, or proprietary code) that have been
> accidentally exposed. Once they find such repositories, they clone
> them to their own accounts or local systems. By doing so, they gain
> access to the codebase and any sensitive data within it ref [4].          
> 
> ### Automated cloning and credential harvesting
> 
> In some cases, threat actors use automated tools to clone public
> repositories. They specifically target repositories containing
> Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials. By cloning these
> repositories, they harvest sensitive credentials, which can later
> be used for unauthorized access, example in ref [5].            
> 
> ### Repo confusion scheme
> 
> This scheme involves cloning existing repositories, Trojanizing them
> (adding malicious code), and re-uploading them. The attackers hope that
> the developers will mistakenly download the infected version.      
> 
> Once a threat actor has access to a CI pipeline, they obtain access key
> or tokens to the SCM-Manager (ref [6]) and can perform action or operation
> allowed for those credentials such as cloning private repository. This may
> lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and/or intellectual
> property theft. Threat actors may identify weaknesses in the code and later
> exploit them.      
> 
> A common command used for repositories cloning is:
> 
> git clone git://github.com/username/reponame.git
> 
> ### Injection of a malicious code directly into exposed libraries
> 
> Some of the threat actor groups are observed to inject malicious code
> directly into exposed libraries or submit fraudulent pull requests.
> This technique can be used in a combination with repository cloning
> to convey a malicious payload and infect developer systems and pilfer
> sensitive files further ref [7].    
>

| APT29               | A 2015 report by F-Secure describe APT29 as: 'The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. The Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States;Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments;organizations associated with Chechen extremism;and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large - scale spear - phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash - and - grab approach involving a fast but noisy breakin followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible.If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long - term intelligence gathering. This threat actor targets government ministries and agencies in the West, Central Asia, East Africa, and the Middle East; Chechen extremist groups; Russian organized crime; and think tanks. It is suspected to be behind the 2015 compromise of unclassified networks at the White House, Department of State, Pentagon, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The threat actor includes all of the Dukes tool sets, including MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, SeaDuke, CloudDuke (aka MiniDionis), and HammerDuke (aka Hammertoss).

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üì® Exfiltration`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that result or aid in an attacker removing data from a target network.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üõ†Ô∏è CI/CD Pipelines`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : CI/CD pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software, ensuring efficient and reliable software delivery.
 - [`üõ†Ô∏è Code Repositories`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Code repositories provide a centralized location for storing and managing source code, enabling version control, collaboration, and code sharing among developers.
 - [`üë§ Developer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Developer
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üî´ Localised incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on an individual, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a small or medium-sized organisation.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`‚ôªÔ∏è Environment dependent`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Depends
