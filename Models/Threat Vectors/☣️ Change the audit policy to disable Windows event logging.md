## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> A threat actor may change an audit policy setting with the purpose of
> disabling Event logging for specific entries. Usually the threat actor will
> disable specific audit policy entries, but other scenarios can be imagined.
> 
> For example, they can change the audit policy settings manually, with
> PowerShell or other scripts, through the registries or by using
> Command-line interface.
> 
> Examples: 
> 
> Command-prompt (cmd) interface:
> 
> auditpol /set /category:"Account Logon" /success:disable /failure:disable
> 
> Where /success or /failure are parameters used for disabling of successful
> or failed events.
> 
> auditpol /Set /Category:* /success:disable
> 
> Where the parameter /Category is used to delete only specific category, set of
> categories or all of them as shown in the example with wildcard (*) character.
> 
> auditpol /clear /y
> auditpol /remove /allusers
> 
> The both commands are used to clear the audit policy settings
> 
> PowerShell commands to modify Audit policies:
> 
> auditpol /get /category:*
> or auditpol /list/category
> PS ~> $AuditPolicyReader::GetClassicAuditPolicy()
> 
> Example for a PowerShell script that change the audit policy to audit
> successful logon events on the local computer. A threat actor can modify
> the $GPO and $SecuritySettingsPath variables to target a different GPO or
> security setting, also can modify $AuditSettingName and $AuditSettingValue
> variables to change the audit policy to a different setting or value.
> 
> Import-Module GroupPolicy
> $GPO = "LocalGPO"
> $SecuritySettingsPath = "Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings"
> $AuditSettingName = "Audit Logon Events"
> 
> # Set the value for the security setting.
> # The values are:
> # 0 = Success and Failure
> # 1 = Success
> # 2 = Failure
> 
> $AuditSettingValue = 1
> $SecuritySettings = Get-GPRegistryValue -Name $GPO -Key $SecuritySettingsPath | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Values
> $AuditSetting = $SecuritySettings | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq $AuditSettingName }
> $AuditSetting.Value = $AuditSettingValue
> Set-GPRegistryValue -Name $GPO -Key $SecuritySettingsPath -Value $SecuritySettings
> gpupdate /force
> 
> 
> For advanced policies, threat actors can use /r to get a csv-formatted table:
> 
> auditpol /get /category:'Account Logon' /r | ConvertFrom-Csv | 
> Format-Table 'Policy Target',Subcategory,'Inclusion Setting'
> 
> Manual change: 
> 
> If the service secpol.msc is running, then a threat actor can navigate to
> Security Settings\Local Policies\Audit Policy to modify the basic policy
> settings or navigate to Security Settings\Advanced Audit Policy
> Configuration to modify advanced policy settings.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üèÉüèΩ Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üñ≤Ô∏è Input/Output Server`](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Input/Output_Server) : The Input/Output (I/O) server provides the interface between the control system LAN applications and the field equipment monitored and controlled by the control system applications. The I/O server, sometimes referred to as a Front-End Processor (FEP) or Data Acquisition Server (DAS), converts the control system application data into packets that are transmitted over various types of communications media to the end device locations. The I/O server also converts data received from the various end devices over different communications mediums into data formatted to communicate with the control system networked applications.
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üìÑ Server Logs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Log or event management
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Web Application Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ≤Ô∏è Control Server`](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Control_Server) : A device which acts as both a server and controller, that hosts the control software used in communicating with lower-level control devices in an ICS network (e.g. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)).

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Windows` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

 [`üîÑ Log tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Log tampering or modification

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

 [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
