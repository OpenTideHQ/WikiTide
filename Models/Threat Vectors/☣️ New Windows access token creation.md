## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> A Windows access token is a data structure that contains information
> about a user's security context, including their security identifier
> (SID), group membership, privileges, and other security-related
> information. When a user logs in, the system generates an access
> token for them. A threat actor may create such access token on
> behalf of the Windows user and to use it to access system resources
> or to escalate privileges for further access or lateral movement
> ref [1].    
> 
> ### Windows access token creation steps
> 
> The access token creation process in Windows involves
> the following steps:
> 
> - The Local Security Authority (LSA) validates the user's
> credentials (e.g., username and password).
> - The LSA creates a security database entry (SDBE) for the user.
> - The LSA generates an access token for the user based on the SDBE
> and the user's security context.
> - The LSA attaches the access token to the user's logon session.
> 
> ### Abuse of Windows API functions to create an access token
> 
> A threat actor can use the native Windows API functions to manipulate
> the access token, such as `DuplicateToken`, `CreateProcessAsUser`,
> `CreateRestrictedToken` and `SetThreadToken`. 
> 
> `CreateRestrictedToken` API  creates a version of an existing token
> with reduced privileges by stripping out certain rights.
> 
> By manipulating these functions, the attacker can create a new token
> with elevated privileges or mimic another user's token ref [3].    
> 
> ### Usage of runas commands
> 
> Threat actors can use a set of runas commands to generate a new user's
> access tokens and to use it on behalf on a legitimate user ref [a, 3].  
> 
> Example:
> 
> `runas /user:domain\administrator cmd`
> 
> The adversaries commonly use user's token to elevate their security
> context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary
> can use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for
> that token if the  account has appropriate permissions on the remote
> system. 
> 
> ### Known toolset used by the threat actors
> 
> - Mimikatz
> - Windows API (WinAPI)
> - PowerShell
> - Windows Token Manager (WNTM)
> - Cobalt Strike
> - Metasploit
> - Windows Internal Database (WID)
> - Token Universe tool, ref [4] 
>

| FIN13              | Since 2017, Mandiant has been tracking FIN13, an industrious and versatile financially motivated threat actor conducting long-term intrusions in Mexico with an activity timeframe stretching back as early as 2016. Although their operations continue through the present day, in many ways FIN13's intrusions are like a time capsule of traditional financial cybercrime from days past. Instead of today's prevalent smash-and-grab ransomware groups, FIN13 takes their time to gather information to perform fraudulent money transfers. Rather than relying heavily on attack frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, the majority of FIN13 intrusions involve heavy use of custom passive backdoors and tools to lurk in environments for the long haul. | TG2003, Elephant Beetle                                                                                                    | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003/ |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üèÉüèΩ Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üîê Auth token`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Authentication token or device
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üß© API Endpoints`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üë§ Customer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Customer

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Windows` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üíÖ Modify privileges`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify privileges or permissions
 - [`ü¶† Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`üò§ Nuisance`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Small and mostly inconsequential to day to day operations, but noticed.
 - [`ü§¨ Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.
 - [`üí≤ Operating costs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Increased operating costs

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
