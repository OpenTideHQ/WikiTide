## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Scheduled tasks in Azure, often called "WebJobs" or "Azure Functions" with timer 
> triggers, are automated processes set to run at specific times or intervals. They 
> are used for maintenance, backups, data processing, and other routine operations.
> 
> This scheduled tasks can be manipulated by threat actors to execute malicious 
> code, steal sensitive information, or disrupt business operations. The manipulation 
> of scheduled tasks can be achieved through various means, including:
> 
> ### Azure metadata service exploitation
> 
> Adversaries can abuse the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) to gather sensitive 
> information about virtual machines.  
> The IMDSv1 endpoint is particularly vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery 
> (SSRF) attacks due to its accessibility via GET requests.
> 
> ### Scheduled events manipulation
> 
> Attackers can exploit Azure scheduled events, a feature of the Azure Metadata 
> Service, to prepare for and execute attacks during VM maintenance windows.  
> This technique allows malicious actors to anticipate system changes and potentially 
> exploit vulnerabilities during maintenance periods.
> 
> ### Custom script extensions
> 
> Threat actors can abuse Custom script extensions, which are designed to automate 
> post-deployment scripts on VMs.  
> This feature can be misused to execute malicious code, install unauthorized software, 
> or reconfigure systems for nefarious purposes.      
> 
> ### Leveraging exploited vulnerabilities
> 
> Attackers can use exploited vulnerabilities in Azure services, such as Azure Automation 
> or Logic Apps, to create more complex, distributed scheduled actions that are harder to detect.
> 
> ### Utilizing obfuscated code
> 
> Attackers might use obfuscated code within tasks to evade detection and make it 
> harder for security teams to identify and mitigate the threat.
> 
> ### Deleting logs and hiding tracks
> 
> Attackers might delete logs related to task creation or modification, and modify 
> task descriptions to seem innocuous, in an attempt to hide their tracks and make 
> it harder to investigate and remediate the attack.
>

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîê Persistence`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `üï∏Ô∏è SaaS` : Subscription based access to software.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`ü™£ Cloud Storage Accounts`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üóùÔ∏è Key Store`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üõ†Ô∏è Virtual Machines`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üß© API Endpoints`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Portal`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Azure` : Placeholder
 - ` Azure AD` : Placeholder
 - ` Office 365` : Placeholder
 - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Linux` : Placeholder

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üóø Repudiation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at performing prohibited operations in a system that lacks the ability to trace the operations.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
