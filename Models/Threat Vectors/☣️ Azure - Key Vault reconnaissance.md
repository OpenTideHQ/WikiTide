## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Azure Key Vault reconnaissance refers to the techniques and activities adversaries 
> use to discover, enumerate, and gather information about Azure Key Vault resources 
> within a target environment. The goal is to identify valuable secrets, misconfigurations, 
> and potential attack paths, often as a precursor to privilege escalation, lateral movement, 
> or data exfiltration.
> 
> ## Why Azure Key Vaults Are Targeted
> 
> - **High Value**: Key Vaults store cryptographic keys, secrets (like API keys and passwords), 
> and certificates, making them attractive to attackers.
> - **Widespread Usage**: They are commonly used by organizations to manage sensitive 
> information for applications and services.
> 
> ## Common Reconnaissance Techniques
> 
> ### Enumeration of Key Vaults
> 
> Attackers with the `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/read` permission can list all Key 
> Vaults in a subscription, revealing vault names and resource groups. This helps 
> identify which vaults to target based on naming conventions or access policies.
> 
> - **Azure CLI Example**:  
>   `az keyvault list --query "[].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup}" -o table`
> 
> ### Listing Keys, Secrets, and Certificates
> 
> Once a vault is identified, attackers may attempt to enumerate keys, secrets, and 
> certificates within it, provided they have appropriate permissions. This can expose 
> metadata that hints at the vault‚Äôs contents and potential value.
> 
> - **Azure CLI Example**:  
>   `az keyvault secret list --vault-name  --query "[].{Name:name, Enabled:attributes.enabled}" -o table`
> 
> ### Access Policy and RBAC Reconnaissance
> 
> Attackers may enumerate access policies and RBAC assignments to identify users, 
> service principals, or managed identities with privileged access. Misconfigurations 
> or excessive permissions can be exploited for further attacks.
> 
> - **Azure CLI Example**:  
>   `az keyvault show --name  --query "properties.accessPolicies[].{ObjectId:objectId, Permissions:permissions}"`
> 
> ### Control Plane vs. Data Plane Enumeration
> 
> Reconnaissance can occur via both the management/control plane (e.g., Azure Resource Manager API) 
> and the data plane (direct Key Vault API). Weak separation or insufficient RBAC 
> enforcement between these planes can increase risk.
> 
> ### Exploiting Network and Access Misconfigurations
> 
> Attackers may probe for Key Vaults with public network access enabled or weak firewall 
> rules, increasing the likelihood of successful enumeration and subsequent attacks.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversaries must first compromise user accounts, service principals, or managed 
> identities that already possess some level of Azure access.

The highly personalized nature of spear-phishing attacks makes it more  difficult to identity than widescale phishing attacks. | [T1566.001 : Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001 'Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems Spearphishing attachment is a spe')                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üî≠ Reconnaissance`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Researching, identifying and selecting targets using active or passive reconnaissance.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`ü™£ Cloud Storage Accounts`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üóùÔ∏è Key Store`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üë§ Identity Services`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üîß Serverless`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üß© API Endpoints`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Portal`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`‚òÅÔ∏è IaaS`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üóÑÔ∏è Relational Database`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üóÑÔ∏è NoSQL Database`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üîë Server Authentication`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Authentication

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Azure` : Placeholder
 - ` Azure AD` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üí∏ Monetary Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : The vector will directly conduct to loss of value directly impacting the bottom line.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
