## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> The following threat vector enables attackers to exfiltrate or manipulate data by 
> generating Shared Access Signature (SAS) URIs for Azure resources such as virtual 
> machine disks or storage containers, often without authentication or sufficient oversight.
> 
> ## Example Attack Scenario
> 
> An adversary with sufficient Azure permissions compromises a resource (like a VM 
> or storage account) and generates an SAS URI for the VM disk or storage container. 
> The attacker then uses the generated SAS URI to download or exfiltrate sensitive 
> data, such as disk images containing credentials or proprietary information. For 
> example, a well-publicized incident involved researchers leaking terabytes of confidential 
> data after distributing SAS-protected links with overly broad permissions.
> 
> ## Attack Goals and Impact
> 
> - The key **attack goal** is **data exfiltration** or unauthorized access to sensitive 
> data without detection or need for ongoing authentication.
> - Attackers can download full VM disks, access entire storage containers, manipulate 
> data, or even inject and delete files if permission scopes are broad.
> - **Impact** includes extensive data breaches, loss of intellectual property, ransom 
> demands, or irreparable harm due to deletion or manipulation of business-critical resources.
> - SAS URIs are particularly dangerous because, once generated, they can't be easily 
> revoked, and their permissions/duration may be overprovisioned by design or accident.
> 
> ## Attack Flow and Methodology
> 
> 1. **Privilege Acquisition**: Attacker gains access to an Azure resource or user 
> account with permissions to generate SAS URIs.
> 2. **SAS Generation**: Using privileged actions (such as 'Microsoft.Compute/disks/beginGetAccess/action' 
> for VM disks or 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listAccountSas/action' for Storage Accounts), 
> the attacker generates a SAS URI for the target resource.
> 3. **Data Access or Exfiltration**: The attacker uses the SAS URI to access, download, 
> modify, or delete data directly, often bypassing logging or security controls if 
> not properly monitored.
> 4. **Persistence and Stealth**: Since SAS URIs can have long or indefinite validity 
> periods and are rarely tracked, the attacker maintains ongoing access until the 
> token expires or underlying keys are rotated.
> 5. **Cleanup or Covering Tracks**: In advanced scenarios, the attacker removes evidence 
> of token generation and exfiltration or uses the access to establish further persistence 
> within the environment.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversaries must gain access to an Azure account or service principal with the required 
> permissions (for example, via stolen credentials or overly-permissive roles) to 
> generate or obtain SAS tokens for targeted storage resources.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üí• Impact`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques aimed at manipulating, interrupting or destroying the target system or data.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

 - [`üõ†Ô∏è Virtual Machines`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Compute Cluster`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üîß Serverless`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Azure` : Placeholder
 - ` Azure AD` : Placeholder

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`üí∏ Monetary Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : The vector will directly conduct to loss of value directly impacting the bottom line.

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
