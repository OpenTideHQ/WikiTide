## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Once they acquired sufficient priviledges,attackers add their own certificate as 
> a trusted entity in the domain either by adding a new federation trust to 
> an existing tenant or modifying the properties of an existing federation 
> trust. As a result, any SAML token they create and sign will be valid for 
> the identity of their choosing. This attack may be performed as an alternative
> to the Golden SAML attack to gain persistent access without having to sign 
> the SAML response at each access request, while needing the same amount of control 
> over the ADFS server.



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Attackers need to have gained administrative Azure Active Directory
> (Azure AD) privileges using compromised credentials

Attackers can get the personal information they need using different ways:   - to compromise an email or messaging system trough other means, - to use OSINT, sourcing Social Media or glean personal information from the user's online presence. They want to craft emails that look as legitimate and attractive as possible  to increase the chances of fooling their targets, for instance sending a malicious  attachment where the filename references a topic the recipient is interested in. The highly personalized nature of spear-phishing attacks makes it more  difficult to identity than widescale phishing attacks. | [T1566.001 : Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001 'Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems Spearphishing attachment is a spe')                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üåê Lateral Movement`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that enable an adversary to horizontally access and control other remote systems.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üë§ Identity Services`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üõ°Ô∏è SAML-Joined Applications`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Azure AD` : Placeholder
 - ` AD FS` : Placeholder
 - ` AWS IAM` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ò¢Ô∏è National cyber emergency`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which causes sustained disruption of (inter)national essential services or affects (inter)national national security, leading to severe economic or social consequences or to loss of life.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

 [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üò± Almost certain`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Nearly certain - 95-99%
