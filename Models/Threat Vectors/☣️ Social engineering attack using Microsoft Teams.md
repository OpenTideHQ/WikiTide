## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Adversaries are using compromised Microsoft 365 tenants to create technical
> support-themed domains and send tech support lures via Microsoft Teams, 
> attempting to trick users of the targeted organizations using social engineering.    
> 
> They aim to manipulate users into granting approval for multifactor authentication
> (MFA) prompts, ultimately aiming to steal their credentials.    
> 
> #### Attack phases    
> 
> **Preparation phase**    
> 
> Attackers compromise an Azure tenant, rename it and add a new onmicrosoft[.]com
> subdomain. It will use security-themed or product name-themed keywords to create
> a new subdomain, such as teamsprotection.onmicrosoft[.]com 
> Add a new user associated with that domain from which the attacker will send the
> outbound message to the target tenant.    
> 
> **Social engineering phase**    
> 
> Attackers send a Teams chat message to the target from the compromised external user
> masquerading as a technical support or security team; if the targeted user accepts
> the message request, attackers send a Microsoft Teams message to convince the target
> to enter a code into the Microsoft Authenticator app on his/her mobile device.
> If the targeted user enters the code into the Authenticator app, the attacker is
> granted a token to authenticate as the targeted user.    
> 
> **Post-compromise phase**    
> 
> Involves information theft from the compromised Microsoft 365 tenant, and in some 
> cases, adding a device to the organisation as a managed device through Microsoft
> Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory), likely an attempt to circumvent conditional
> access policies configured to restrict access to specific resources to managed devices only.    
> 
> #### Additional Tactics: Microsoft Teams Vishing    
> 
> ### Microsoft Teams Vishing    
> 
> - Attackers initiate contact via Microsoft Teams within 15-30 minutes of the email bombing.
> - They pose as IT support personnel or "Help Desk Managers".
> - Adversary-controlled Office 365 accounts are used, often with display names mimicking 
> legitimate IT staff.
> - Profile pictures and backgrounds are crafted to appear authentic.
> - Attackers exploit the victim's state of confusion and urgency caused by the email bombing.    
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Attacker has compromised a valid Microsoft 365 tenant to host the lures, and valid
> valid credentials in targeted M365 tenant too.
> Targeted organizations must use an app like Microsoft Authenticator as second
> factor (app taking the code received after successful authentication granted by 
> the victim, the user, in previous step).

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üì¶ Delivery`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

 [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 [` Microsoft Teams`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/) : Microsoft Teams is a proprietary business communication platform developed by Microsoft, as part of the Microsoft 365 family of products. Teams primarily competes with the similar service Slack, offering workspace chat and videoconferencing, file storage, and application integration.

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

 [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`‚ôªÔ∏è Environment dependent`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Depends
