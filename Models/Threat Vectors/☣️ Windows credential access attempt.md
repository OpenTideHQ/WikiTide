## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Windows credential access refers to techniques used by threat
> actors to steal authentication information such as passwords,
> hashes, tokens, or Kerberos tickets stored on or transmitted
> by Windows systems. These credentials enable unauthorized
> access to systems, networks, or sensitive data, facilitating
> lateral movement, privilege escalation, or persistent control.  
> 
> Threat actors exploit Windows credential access using various tools
> and Living Off The Land Binaries (LOLBins) utilities to gain
> unauthorized access to sensitive information.  
> 
> Windows credentials usually are stored in two main locations.
> 
> ### Credentials folder (Windows Vault)
> 
> This folder stores encrypted copies of user credentials used
> by Windows services, applications, and scheduled tasks.
> Example for path storing credentials in Windows
> 
> `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials`
> `C:\Users\<username>\%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Credentials\`
> 
> where <username> is the logged-in user's account name.  
> 
> ### Credential Manager
> 
> It's location is not fixed. The store of the user credentisls
> in this case may vary depending on the user account and other
> system settings as language and preferences.  
> 
> The Windows OS has many different places it stores or caches its 
> credentials, such as:  
> 
> - Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database. 
> The SAM database is a file present on all Windows systems. This file 
> contains all accounts created, as well as all built-in accounts.
> Passwords are stored here as hashes. (NT password hash) 
> - Other Files 
> Passwords can also be found in configuration files and user created files 
> (usually plaintext). Certain log files may contain credential information,
> such as installer logs, and can also sometimes be found in crash reports. 
> - Cached Credentials 
> Domain credentials are cached in the registry to allow users to log into their
> system when it is not connected to the domain. The Windows system caches the last
> 10 logon hashes, and some store up to 25 by default. This number is configurable. 
> - Local Security Authority Secret (LSA) 
> LSA secrets are stored in the registry and allow services to run with user privileges.
> This includes VPNs, scheduled tasks, auto-logins, backup service accounts, IIS websites, etc.
> They are included in the Security/Policy/Secrets registry in encrypted form. 
> - Local Security Authority Subsystem Service Process (LSASS) 
> When logging into a Windows machine, credentials are stored in the LSASS process in memory. 
> This is primarily used to allow the user to access other resources on the network that they
> are authorized to access without having to re-authenticate. The stored formats can be
> plaintext (reversable encryption), NT and LM hash, and Kerberos tickets. 
> - Credential Store Manager 
> The manager is available with Windows 7 and higher. It is basically a digital vault that 
> allows users to store user credentials ‚Äúsafely.‚Äù All the credentials are stored in a 
> specific folder on the Windows system. Windows and Web credentials can be stored here. 
> - AD Domain database (NTDS.DIT)
> This database stores all credentials for users and computers located on every
> AD Domain controller server in an active directory domain environment. (%SystemRoot%\NTDS folder) 
> 
> ### Known used tools for Windows credential dumping and access ref [1]
> 
> - Mimikatz: A popular tool used to extract plaintext passwords,
> hash, PIN codes, and Kerberos tickets from memory. It can also
> perform pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket, and build Golden Tickets.
> - CrackMapExec: An open-source hacking tool for Windows Active
> Directory environments.
> - Empire: a post-exploitation and adversary emulation framework
> - BloodHound: An open-source tool that uses graph theory to reveal
> the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active
> Directory environment. 
> - Hashcat: A password cracking tool that can crack Windows hashes,
> including NTLM and LM hashes.
> - John the Ripper: A password cracking tool that can crack Windows
> passwords using dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, or rainbow
> table attacks.
> - PsExec: A tool that allows executing commands on remote systems,
> which can be used to extract credentials.
> - Built-in Windows OS utilities as reg.exe for registry access,
> WMI Windows utility, cmd, tasklist and others. 
> 
> ### Possible used LOLBins utilities ref [2]:
> 
> - Windows Credential Editor (WCE): A utility that allows modifying
> Windows credentials, including adding new credentials or modifying
> existing ones.
> - cmdkey: A built-in Windows utility that allows managing cached
> credentials, including adding, deleting, or listing credentials.
> - runas: A built-in Windows utility that allows running commands
> under a different user context, which can be used to exploit
> credentials.
> - PowerShell: A powerful scripting language that can be used to
> exploit credentials, including using cmdlets like Get-Credential
> or Invoke-Command.
> - tasklist: A built-in Windows utility that can be used to list
> running processes, including those running under different user
> contexts, which can help identify potential credential
> exploitation opportunities.
> - wmic: A built-in Windows utility that provides a command-line
> interface to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) repository,
> which can be used to exploit credentials.
>

| APT29               | A 2015 report by F-Secure describe APT29 as: 'The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. The Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States;Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments;organizations associated with Chechen extremism;and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large - scale spear - phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash - and - grab approach involving a fast but noisy breakin followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible.If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long - term intelligence gathering. This threat actor targets government ministries and agencies in the West, Central Asia, East Africa, and the Middle East; Chechen extremist groups; Russian organized crime; and think tanks. It is suspected to be behind the 2015 compromise of unclassified networks at the White House, Department of State, Pentagon, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The threat actor includes all of the Dukes tool sets, including MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, SeaDuke, CloudDuke (aka MiniDionis), and HammerDuke (aka Hammertoss).

| [ICS] Lazarus Group | [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) is a North Korean state-sponsored cyber threat group that has been attributed to the Reconnaissance General Bureau.(Citation: US-CERT HIDDEN COBRA June 2017)(Citation: Treasury North Korean Cyber Groups September 2019) The group has been active since at least 2009 and was reportedly responsible for the November 2014 destructive wiper attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment as part of a campaign named Operation Blockbuster by Novetta. Malware used by [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) correlates to other reported campaigns, including Operation Flame, Operation 1Mission, Operation Troy, DarkSeoul, and Ten Days of Rain.(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster)North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the name [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) instead of tracking clusters or subgroups, such as [Andariel](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0138), [APT37](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0067), [APT38](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082), and [Kimsuky](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Diamond Sleet, Guardians of Peace, HIDDEN COBRA, Labyrinth Chollima, NICKEL ACADEMY, ZINC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | üó°Ô∏è MITRE ATT&CK Groups     | No documented sighting                                                                                                                                                                          | No documented references                                                                                       |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîë Credential Access`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques resulting in the access of, or control over, system, service or domain credentials.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üõ†Ô∏è Virtual Machines`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Active Directory` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`ü¶† Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
