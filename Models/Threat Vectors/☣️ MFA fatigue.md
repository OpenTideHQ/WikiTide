## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> MFA fatigue (aka MFA abuse, MFA bombing or MFA spamming) is a popular technique
> due to its low complexity and high success rate.
> 
> It is a social engineering attack strategy where attackers repeatedly push
> second-factor authentication requests to the target user email, phone, or registered
> devices. The goal is to spam users to the point where they are annoyed by the constant 
> notifications and approve one so it will stop. By doing so, the attacker has effectively 
> bypassed MFA by tricking the user into approving the login attempt.
> 
> The fact that the attacker can trigger MFA push notifications means they obtained
> the credentials of the user. This attack is often preceded by other social engineering
> attack vectors, such as phishing, to gain credentials. Stolen credentials may also
> be acquired from the dark web or via many other attack vectors.
> 
> Attacker may trigger push notifications throughout the day with the hopes that
> one of the attempts will coincide with the user login activity, so the user will
> approve it without suspicion.
> 
> MFA fatigue attack chain unfolds as follows:
> 
> 1. User credentials and information are collected.
> The attack begins with user information already available. The attacker will typically
> have access to a victim username, password, or recovery credentials. This might be
> sourced from preliminary attacks (such as phishing or social engineering) or may have
> been exposed credentials from a larger breach.
> 
> 2. Stolen credentials are used to send MFA push notifications.
> The attackers then use the gained credentials to sign-in to a target account or device
> secured by push multi-factor authentication. Typically, the attacker will attempt
> to activate the authenticating application push notifications in quick succession.
> These push notifications can happen over email, text message, or desktop notification,
> but are generally pushed to the user authenticated mobile device.
> 
> 3. User gets push notifications and becomes fatigued.
> The user will now rapidly receive push notifications as the attacker attempts to
> overwhelm them. The attacker goal is for the victim to push ‚Äúyes‚Äù and confirm their
> identity, allowing the attacker to go further into their account or device.
> Often, the user may think it is a simple application malfunction or a test,
> or just want the notifications to end out of annoyance.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîë Credential Access`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques resulting in the access of, or control over, system, service or domain credentials.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üîê Auth token`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Authentication token or device
 - [`‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Portal`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üë§ Helpdesk`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Helpdesk
 - [`üë§ Identity Services`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üì± Mobile phone`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Mobile phone or smartphone

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` EU Login` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

 [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
