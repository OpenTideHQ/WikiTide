## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Credential dumping is the process of extracting sensitive information, such
> as passwords, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text content, as well
> as any other secrets stored on the compromised host ref [1], [2].         
> 
> On Windows, the user's passwords and secrets can be stored in multiple
> possible locations, accessible with Windows File Explorer.  
> 
> For example:
> 
> ### Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database location
> 
> Location of the SAM database, contains the local users of the host as well
> as the local groups: 
> 
> `%SystemRoot%/system32/config/SAM`
> 
> ### Windows Security configuration file
> 
> Security config file contains LSA Secrets, for example DPAPI machine key,
> account cleartext passwords for Windows services or scheduled tasks that
> are configured on the host. Data Protection API (DPAPI) performs symmetric
> encryption of asymmetric private keys and it's used by the operation system
> to securely store passwords, encryption keys or any other type of sensitive
> data ref [3], [4] and [5].        
> 
> `%SystemRoot%/system32/config/SECURITY`
> 
> ### AppData local user folder
> 
> AppData in the local user folder contains cleartext passwords,
> web browsers cookies and other cached browser data:  
> 
> `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Vault\<GUID>`
> 
> ### Other possible Windows explorer locations for browsing
> 
> Some other paths in Windows Explorer may contain password manager details,
> for example KeePass Password Database or similar.  
> 
> Examples for paths in Windows Explorer (local locations or network shares):
> 
> - `C:\Users\Public\TempWorkingFiles\PGM\Documents\Keepass\`
> - `C:\Users\vernada\AppData\Local\Microsoft\AppV\Client\Integration\{identifier_string}\Root`
> - `C:\ProgramData\AppV\{identifier_string}\Root\KeePass.exe`
> - `C:\Users\USERNAME\Downloads\EBSI credentials\`
> - `E:\KeePass-db\`  
> 
> ### Automated scripts
> 
> The threat actors are using automated scripts that can search for specific
> file extentions in Windows Explorer that usually contain sensitive data as 
> user and system credentials.  
> 
> #### Batch script to search for files by a name
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> @echo off
> set /p search_term=Enter search term: 
> for /f "delims=" %%a in ('dir /b /s *%search_term%*') do echo %%a
> ```
> 
> #### PowerShell script to search for files in Windows by content
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> $search_term = Read-Host "Enter search term"
> Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse | Select-String -Pattern $search_term
> ```
> 
> #### Known extentions for files (possible to be discovered via Windows Explorer)
> 
> Browsing through Windows Explorer, threat actors are usually looking for
> file extentions of files which may contain user's credentials ref [6].  
> 
> Example for file extensions that may contain credentials:  
> 
> - Compressed (archive) files: .zip, .tar, .gz, .tgz, .rar, and others
> - Java source files: .java
> - Text files: .txt
> - PDF documents: .pdf 
> - Office file documents: .doc, .docx, .rtf, .xlsx, .pptx, .pps, .ppsm, .ppsx, .ppt
> - Backup files: .bak, .old and others
> - Archive files: .7z, .zip , .rar
> - Database files: .kd , kdbx, mdb
> - Configuration files: .config, .xml, .xsml, .xsl, .xsd, .xps, .sys
> - Execution files: .exe, .cmd, .ps1
> - Libraries: .dll
> - Shell configuration files: .bashrc, .zshrc, .cshrc
> - User AWS Folder .aws/credentials
> - Other possible files that may contain credentials: csv, tmp, .ssh, .wxs

It has been characterized as an advanced persistent threat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Pawn Storm, FANCY BEAR, Sednit, SNAKEMACKEREL, Tsar Team, TG-4127, STRONTIUM, Swallowtail, IRON TWILIGHT, Group 74, SIG40, Grizzly Steppe, G0007, ATK5, Fighting Ursa, ITG05, Blue Athena, TA422, T-APT-12, APT-C-20, UAC-0028, FROZENLAKE, Sofacy, Forest Blizzard, BlueDelta, Fancy Bear, GruesomeLarch | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | Cyber-espionage groups linked to the Russian government oftenuse Microsoft Windows, Office, and Internet Explorer exploitsto compromise their targets ref [5]. | https://news.softpedia.com/news/russian-apts-prefer-windows-office-internet-explorer-exploits-507051.shtml |

| APT29              | A 2015 report by F-Secure describe APT29 as: 'The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. The Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States;Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments;organizations associated with Chechen extremism;and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large - scale spear - phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash - and - grab approach involving a fast but noisy breakin followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible.If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long - term intelligence gathering. This threat actor targets government ministries and agencies in the West, Central Asia, East Africa, and the Middle East; Chechen extremist groups; Russian organized crime; and think tanks. It is suspected to be behind the 2015 compromise of unclassified networks at the White House, Department of State, Pentagon, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The threat actor includes all of the Dukes tool sets, including MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, SeaDuke, CloudDuke (aka MiniDionis), and HammerDuke (aka Hammertoss).

It also appears OilRig carries out supply chain attacks, where the threat group leverages the trust relationship between organizations to attack their primary targets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Twisted Kitten, Cobalt Gypsy, Crambus, Helix Kitten, APT 34, APT34, IRN2, ATK40, G0049, Evasive Serpens, Hazel Sandstorm, EUROPIUM, TA452, Earth Simnavaz                                                                                                                                                 | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting                                                                                                                                         | https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/behind-the-scenes-with-oilrig                                          |

|                    | OilRig is an active and organized threat group, which is evident based on their systematic targeting of specific organizations that appear to be carefully chosen for strategic purposes. Attacks attributed to this group primarily rely on social engineering to exploit the human rather than software vulnerabilities; however, on occasion this group has used recently patched vulnerabilities in the delivery phase of their attacks. The lack of software vulnerability exploitation does not necessarily suggest a lack of sophistication, as OilRig has shown maturity in other aspects of their operations. Such maturities involve:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                            |                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                            |

|                    | OilRig relies on stolen account credentials for lateral movement. After OilRig gains access to a system, they use credential dumping tools, such as Mimikatz, to steal credentials to accounts logged into the compromised system. The group uses these credentials to access and to move laterally to other systems on the network. After obtaining credentials from a system, operators in this group prefer to use tools other than their backdoors to access the compromised systems, such as remote desktop and putty. OilRig also uses phishing sites to harvest credentials to individuals at targeted organizations to gain access to internet accessible resources, such as Outlook Web Access.Since at least 2014, an Iranian threat group tracked by FireEye as APT34 has conducted reconnaissance aligned with the strategic interests of Iran. The group conducts operations primarily in the Middle East, targeting financial, government, energy, chemical, telecommunications and other industries. Repeated targeting of Middle Eastern financial, energy and government organizations leads FireEye to assess that those sectors are a primary concern of APT34. The use of infrastructure tied to Iranian operations, timing and alignment with the national interests of Iran also lead FireEye to assess that APT34 acts on behalf of the Iranian government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                            |                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                            |

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
