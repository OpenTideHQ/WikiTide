## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> 
> ### The SMB Protocol
> SMB stands for Server Message Block. It is a network protocol used to 
> share data between computers and devices on a local or wide area network. 
> The protocol allows local network computers to interact with file shares.
> 
> Threat actors frequently exploit SMB for their nefarious activities. 
> One common tactic involves leveraging SMB to interact with file shares, including Microsoft Sharepoints, OneDrive or some NAS servers. 
> In doing so, adversaries can pull malicious files from compromised endpoints, 
> paving the way for the execution of additional malicious code. 
> This method poses a significant threat, as it allows for the clandestine transfer of harmful files between systems, 
> thereby supporting lateral movement within the network. 
> Threat actors may exploit inherent file sharing protocols like SMB/Windows Admin Shares, 
> either to connected network shares or through authenticated connections via Remote Desktop Protocol.
> 
> Moreover, the embedding of files can serve as a vector for initiating SMB connections. 
> For instance, embedded files containing links executed by Office applications may establish 
> connections with SMB servers under the threat actor's control. This technique allows threat actors to exploit unsuspecting users, 
> initiating SMB connections that may lead to the execution of malicious code.
> 
> In a more advanced scenario, threat actors might specify a malicious server, 
> directing the SMB protocol to facilitate further code execution. 
> This strategic move enables them to retrieve various types of files, potentially leading to widespread infection across entire machines within the network. 
> The ability to specify a malicious server amplifies the threat, 
> as it allows threat actors to exercise greater control over the execution and distribution of harmful payloads, posing a severe risk to the overall security of the network.

## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Iniating a SMB connection requires a valid user account which imply

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üì¶ Delivery`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üñ•Ô∏è Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Web Application Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Office 365` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`ü¶† Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`üì¶ Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

 [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
