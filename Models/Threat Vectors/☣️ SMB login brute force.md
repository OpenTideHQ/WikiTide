## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> SMB (Server Message Block) brute-force is a type of cyber attack where an
> attacker attempts to guess the password for an SMB share by trying a large
> number of possible passwords. The goal is to gain unauthorised access to
> the SMB share, which can contain sensitive data, such as files, folders,
> and other resources.
> 
> ### Different methods and techniques used by the threat actors to brute-force an SMB share
> 
> - Dictionary attacks - a threat actor is using in this type of an attack a
> list of common passwords, such as words, phrases, and combinations of
> characters, to try and guess the password.
> - Brute force attacks - a threat actor is trying all possible combinations
> of characters, numbers, and special characters to guess the password.
> - Password spraying - in this technique a threat actor uses a small number
> of common passwords against a large number of usernames, in an attempt to
> guess the password for at least one account.
> - Hybrid attacks - combining dictionary and brute force attacks to try and
> guess the password.
> - Rainbow Table Attacks - this is a possible brute-force attack in which a
> threat actor is using precomputed tables of hash values for common
> passwords to try and guess the password.
> - Exploiting weak passwords - a threat actor may identify and exploit weak
> passwords, such as default passwords, easily guessable passwords, or
> passwords that have not been changed in a long time.
> 
> They can use eumeration tools like nmap, smbclient, Metaspoit and others to
> listen for an open SMB port and perform automated brute-forcing password
> matches against an SMB share. 
> 
> ### Automated script tools used for SMB brute-force attack
> 
> Threat actors may use different automated tools which have the capability
> to use a wordlist and to try logon attemts to an SMB share. For example,
> bat, batch, PowerShell or other type of scripts and tools based on these
> scripts ref [3], [4], [5], [7].  
> 
> Examples:
> 
> - smbrute.bat              (uses `passlist.txt` wordlist) ref [3];
> - Smb.bat script           (uses `Wordlist.txt` wordlist) ref [4];
> - SMBLogin.ps1 script      for more information ref [5]. 
> - smblogin-extra-mini.ps1  (uses .\smblogin.results.txt wordlist)
>   Minimalistic offensive tool based on PowerShell ref [7].
> 
> ### Metasploit auxiliary module brute-force SMB share
> 
> A threat actor can use a Metasploit auxiliary scanner module to brute force
> the SMB credentials. In the example below `<user_file>.txt` is a set of
> user's possible names and `<password_file>.txt` is a list of possible user's
> password for brute-force attack ref [2].   
> 
> Example: 
> 
> ```
> > set RHOST <ip_address>
> RHOST => <ip_address>
> > set PORT 445
> RPORT => 445
> > set user_file ./<user_file>.txt
> user_file => ./<user_file>.txt
> > set password_file ./<password_file>.txt
> password_file => ./<password_file>.txt
> 
> ```
> Metaspoit `run` command runs the auxiliary module and displays if there are
> found successful brute-force credentials matches. 
> 
> ```
> msf5 auxilary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > run
> 
> ```

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîë Credential Access`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques resulting in the access of, or control over, system, service or domain credentials.

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`‚õî Denial of Service`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action attempting to deny access to valid users, such as by making a web server temporarily unavailable or unusable.

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`ü§¨ Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.
