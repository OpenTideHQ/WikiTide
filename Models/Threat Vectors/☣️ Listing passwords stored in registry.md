## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Listing passwords stored in the Windows Registry is a technique employed by adversaries 
> to extract sensitive credentials from compromised systems. The Windows Registry is a 
> centralized database that stores configuration settings and options for the operating 
> system and installed applications. Some applications, due to misconfigurations or poor 
> security practices, store user credentials in the registry, sometimes in plaintext 
> or in an easily reversible format.  
> 
> Threat actors may use the built-in Windows command-line utility reg.exe to query registry 
> keys that potentially contain stored credentials.  
> 
> ```bat
> reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s
> ```
> This command is scanning registry hives for the value password.  
> 
> PowerShell provides a powerful scripting environment that can recursively search the 
> registry for keys containing specific terms like "password."  
> 
> ```powershell
> Get-ChildItem -Path Registry:: -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
> Get-ItemProperty |
> Where-Object { $_.PSObject.Properties.Name -match "Password" -and $_.Password }
> ```
> This script searches all registry keys for properties named "Password" and lists them if found.  
> 
> Some applications store credentials in specific registry locations. For example, 
> VPN clients or database tools might store user credentials under their software keys in HKCU or HKLM hives.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversary must have access to a Windows system where applications store credentials 
> in the registry and possess sufficient privileges to read registry keys 
> containing those credentials.

| UNC1878             | UNC1878 is a financially motivated threat actor that monetizes network access via the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Earlier this year, Mandiant published a blog on a fast-moving adversary deploying RYUK ransomware, UNC1878. Shortly after its release, there was a significant decrease in observed UNC1878 intrusions and RYUK activity overall almost completely vanishing over the summer. But beginning in early fall, Mandiant has seen a resurgence of RYUK along with TTP overlaps indicating that UNC1878 has returned from the grave and resumed their operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

[Turla](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010) is known for conducting watering hole and spearphishing campaigns, and leveraging in-house tools and malware, such as [Uroburos](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0022).(Citation: Kaspersky Turla)(Citation: ESET Gazer Aug 2017)(Citation: CrowdStrike VENOMOUS BEAR)(Citation: ESET Turla Mosquito Jan 2018)(Citation: Joint Cybersecurity Advisory AA23-129A Snake Malware May 2023)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | BELUGASTURGEON, Group 88, IRON HUNTER, Krypton, Secret Blizzard, Snake, Venomous Bear, Waterbug, WhiteBear                                                                                                                                                                                                | üó°Ô∏è MITRE ATT&CK Groups     | No documented sighting | No documented references |
| Turla               | A 2014 Guardian article described Turla as: 'Dubbed the Turla hackers, initial intelligence had indicated western powers were key targets, but it was later determined embassies for Eastern Bloc nations were of more interest. Embassies in Belgium, Ukraine, China, Jordan, Greece, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Poland, and Germany were all attacked, though researchers from Kaspersky Lab and Symantec could not confirm which countries were the true targets. In one case from May 2012, the office of the prime minister of a former Soviet Union member country was infected, leading to 60 further computers being affected, Symantec researchers said. There were some other victims, including the ministry for health of a Western European country, the ministry for education of a Central American country, a state electricity provider in the Middle East and a medical organisation in the US, according to Symantec. It is believed the group was also responsible for a much - documented 2008 attack on the US Central Command. The attackers - who continue to operate - have ostensibly sought to carry out surveillance on targets and pilfer data, though their use of encryption across their networks has made it difficult to ascertain exactly what the hackers took.Kaspersky Lab, however, picked up a number of the attackers searches through their victims emails, which included terms such as Nato and EU energy dialogue Though attribution is difficult to substantiate, Russia has previously been suspected of carrying out the attacks and Symantecs Gavin O‚Äô Gorman told the Guardian a number of the hackers appeared to be using Russian names and language in their notes for their malicious code. Cyrillic was also seen in use.' | Snake, VENOMOUS Bear, Group 88, Waterbug, WRAITH, Uroburos, Pfinet, TAG_0530, KRYPTON, Hippo Team, Pacifier APT, Popeye, SIG23, IRON HUNTER, MAKERSMARK, ATK13, G0010, ITG12, Blue Python, SUMMIT, UNC4210, Secret Blizzard, UAC-0144, UAC-0024, UAC-0003                                                 | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üóÉÔ∏è Collection`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques used to identify and gather data from a target network prior to exfiltration.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`ü¶† Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
