## 👁️ Description

> A "malicious profile" refers to a configuration file installed on a mobile device 
> that compromises its security and privacy. These profiles exploit the device's settings 
> to grant attackers unauthorized control or access to sensitive data, making them 
> a serious threat vector for mobile devices.
> 
> ### How Malicious Profiles Are Installed
> 
> Attackers use various techniques to deploy malicious profiles on devices:
> 
> 1. **Phishing Attacks**: Victims are tricked into clicking links or downloading 
> files via phishing emails or websites. These links often promise to fix security 
> issues or provide valuable services, convincing users to install the malicious profile.
> 
> 2. **Social Engineering**: Attackers manipulate users into believing the profile 
> is legitimate, often using fake security alerts or enticing offers.
> 
> 3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Over unsecured Wi-Fi networks, attackers 
> intercept communications and install malicious profiles by redirecting traffic through 
> spoofed hotspots.
> 
> 4. **Third-Party App Stores**: Android users may unknowingly install malicious apps 
> containing configuration profiles from unverified sources.
> 
> ### Implications of Malicious Profiles
> 
> Malicious profiles can severely compromise a device's security, privacy, and functionality:
> 
> 1. **Persistent Control**: Once installed, these profiles often cannot be removed 
> manually, allowing attackers long-term control over the device settings.
> 
> 2. **Data Interception**:
>   - Profiles may configure devices to route traffic through malicious VPNs or proxy 
>   servers, enabling attackers to intercept and decrypt sensitive information such 
>   as emails, banking credentials, and social media passwords.
>   - Installation of untrusted root certificates allows attackers to bypass TLS/SSL 
>   encryption and impersonate secure websites.
> 
> 3. **Surveillance Capabilities**:
>   - Attackers can record conversations, monitor messages, and even capture audio 
>   from the environment using malicious profiles.
>   - Corporate devices are particularly vulnerable as attackers may redirect email 
>   traffic or manipulate enterprise configurations.
> 
> 4. **Device Misconfiguration**:
>   - Malicious profiles can alter Wi-Fi settings, enforce insecure passcodes, or 
>   disable security apps, weakening the device’s overall security posture.
> 
> 5. **Persistence for Future Attacks**:
>   - By tampering with trust settings (e.g., certificates), attackers ensure that 
>   the device implicitly trusts them for future actions without user intervention.
> 
> ### Examples of Exploits
> 
> - **iOS Devices**:
>   Attackers exploit configuration vulnerabilities by installing untrusted profiles 
>   that intercept secure connections and manipulate user sessions. For example, phishing 
>   campaigns may trick users into downloading profiles that hijack email traffic 
>   or steal credentials.
> 
> - **Android Devices**:
>   Malware such as "Godless" exploits older Android versions by embedding malicious 
>   configuration files within apps downloaded from third-party stores. These files 
>   gain root access and install spyware for complete device takeover.
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > Adversaries rely on social engineering (e.g., phishing emails/SMS with fake security alerts), 
> and infrastructure such as spoofed domains, third-party app stores, or MitM tools 
> to distribute payloads or force installations.

## Model Data

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `📱 Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Android` : Placeholder

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`👁️‍🗨️ Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`⚙️ Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`💅 Modify privileges`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify privileges or permissions
 - [`👻 Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user’s credentials, such as username and password.

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🦹 Asset and fraud`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Asset and fraud-related losses
 - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`🥸 Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`🧠 IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`😤 Nuisance`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Small and mostly inconsequential to day to day operations, but noticed.

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
