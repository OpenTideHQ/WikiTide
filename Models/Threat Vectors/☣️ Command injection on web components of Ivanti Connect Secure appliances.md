## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Attackers may manage to inject commands to an Ivanti Connect Secure 
> appliance (that provide remote VPN access to corporate 
> infrastructures) either with valid credentials for vulnerable 
> authenticated endpoints or exploiting a vulnerability to bypass 
> authentication.  
> 
> These vulnerabilities are identified as CVE-2024-21888 and 
> CVE-2024-21893. CVE-2024-21893 have been exploited in the wild chained 
> with CVE-2024-21887 and can lead to remote adversaries to execute 
> arbitrary commands on targeted gateways.
> 
> In addition to the list of LOLbins see [3], following commands were 
> used in the ICS attack is the following:
> - aria2c
> - at
> - cat 
> - check_ssl_cert
> - crash
> - crontab
> - echo
> - mount
> - nohup
> - pidstat
> - sed
> - split
> - sysctl
> - tcpdump
> - wireshark

| Gelsemium | The Gelsemium group has been active since at least 2014 and was described in the past by a few security companies. Gelsemium‚Äôs name comes from one possible translation ESET found while reading a report from VenusTech who dubbed the group ÁãºÊØíËçâ for the first time. It‚Äôs the name of a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Gelsemiaceae, Gelsemium elegans is the species that contains toxic compounds like Gelsemine, Gelsenicine and Gelsevirine, which ESET choses as names for the three components of this malware family. | ÁãºÊØíËçâ       | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üí• Exploitation`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in systems that may, amongst others, result in code execution.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üîß Embedded` : Firmware, middleware and low level software running on devices which are typically not manageable by the consumer.
 - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `üåê Networking` : Communications backbone connecting users, applications and machines.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üïπÔ∏è Remote access`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Remote access
 - [`üõ°Ô∏è VPN Client`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Placeholder` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üö® Highly significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on central government, (inter)national essential services, a large proportion of the (inter)national population, or the (inter)national economy.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üîÑ Log tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Log tampering or modification
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üîê New Accounts`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Ability to create new arbitrary user accounts.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`üí≤ Operating costs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Increased operating costs
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üò± Almost certain`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Nearly certain - 95-99%
