## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> When working with PowerShell, a threat actor can encode a command or script
> using Base64 or other type of encoding and pass it as a parameter to the
> command line. This technique is useful for obfuscating sensitive
> information or executing complex commands. (ref [1])   
> 
> 
> The malicious document contains a macro which, upon execution,
> creates a batch script at C:\Users\public\new[.]bat with the
> following content:  
> 
> powershell -exec bypass -noP -w hidden -nonI -enc"{string}" del %0;
> 
> Other possible examples for encoding with PowerShell commands: 
> 
> Encoding a Command with Base64
> 
> 1. Create a command as a string. 
> 
> $command = 'dir "C:\Program Files"'
> 
> 2. Convert the command to Base64:
> 
> $bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($command)
> $encodedCommand = [Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes)
> 
> Now you can run the encoded command using powershell.exe:
> 
> powershell.exe -encodedCommand $encodedCommand
> 
> It's also possible to encode domain names, for example: 
> 
> Powershell input:
> 
> [Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes("'sample_domain.com'"))
> 
> Threat actors also use PowerShell scripts for faster encoding process and result.  
> 
> An example of Powershell script (ref [2])  
> 
> param(
> [Parameter()][Alias("un")][string]$Username,
> [Parameter()][Alias("pw")][string]$Password
> )
> 
> Write-Host "Username: $Username"
> Write-Host "Password: $Password"
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > A threat actors need an initial access to the system to use PowerShell
> console to execute commands to obfuscate their traffic and activities.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üèÉüèΩ Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üïπÔ∏è Remote access`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Remote access
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` PowerShell` : Placeholder
 - ` Windows` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üî´ Localised incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on an individual, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a small or medium-sized organisation.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`ü¶† Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

 [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
