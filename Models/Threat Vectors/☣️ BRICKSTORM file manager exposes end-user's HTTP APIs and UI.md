## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> One of the observed China-nexus cluster achieves their goals with
> the involvement and the usage of previously unknown vulnerabilities
> (a.k.a., zero-days) alongside with low-noise backdoors like `BRICKSTORM`
> family.
> 
> The unauthorised access provided by `BRICKSTORM` grants attackers the
> ability to execute file management and network tunneling functions
> crucial for espionage. These capabilities enable them to browse file
> systems, create or delete files and directories, and establish network
> connections to facilitate lateral movement within the compromised
> environment. Unlike many other forms of malware that create noticeable
> disruptions, BRICKSTORM's operations are meticulously crafted to avoid
> detection, maintaining a consistent and clandestine presence within
> the target network ref [3]. 
> 
> Recently identified `BRICKSTORM` executables provide threat actors
> with a file manager named `BRICKSTORM file manager`.   
> 
> The `BRICKSTORM file manager` exposes an HTTP API and rudimentary UI
> (User Interface) encapsulated within the protocol. The backdoor's
> JSON-based API provides a wide range of file-related actions such
> as uploading, downloading, renaming, and deleting files.
> 
> Adversaries can further-more create or delete directories as well
> as list their contents. The BRICKSTORM panel is served by the malware
> itself and proxied through its protocol towards a Command & Control
> server. Further this functionality and specific behavior allows the
> adversary to select a drive they wish to browse. Once the drive is
> selected, BRICKSTORM allows the adversaries to browse through the
> file system and download files by their choice ref [1].

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üß≠ Discovery`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that allow an attacker to gain knowledge about a system and its network environment.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üß© API Endpoints`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Web Application Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Linux` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üî´ Localised incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on an individual, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a small or medium-sized organisation.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`‚ú® Modify data`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify stored data or content

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`ü§¨ Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.
 - [`üí≤ Operating costs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Increased operating costs

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
