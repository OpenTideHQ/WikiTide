## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Threat actors can use PowerShell to disable Windows event logging.
> They use this technique for example to disable diagnostic eventlogs
> or some individual Windows log (for example: Application, Security
> or System log).
> 
> Disabling of Application log can cause lost of the tracks for specific
> application, for example: lack of visibility for authentication, time of
> logon, failure events of the application or other related application
> details.
> 
> Threat actors may disable Security Event log to prevent detection of
> their logons on the system: number of logons, timestamp of the logon and 
> with what privilege account and username they logon on the system. 
> 
> PowerShell command to clear event logs with 'Disable-EventLog' cmdlet:
> 
> Disable-EventLog -LogName "Parameter"
> where the "Parameter" can be Application, Security or System
> 
> Example how to clear individual logs with -ListLog parameter:
> 
> (Get-WinEvent -ListLog *).LogName | %{[System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogSession]::GlobalSession.ClearLog($_)}
> 
> The threat actors can specify the logname and clear an individual log with:
> [System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogSession]::GlobalSession.ClearLog("Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Diagnostic")
> 
> With the following section the Event log is disabled competely:
> 
> $wineventlog = get-winevent -ListLog "Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Diagnostic" -ComputerName hyperv-01
> $wineventlog.IsEnabled = $false
> $wineventlog.SaveChanges()
> 
> If the threat actors want to disable multiple event logs at once, they can
> use a loop in their customly prepared PowerShell script to iterate through a
> list of event log names and disable them one by one.
> 
> Example:
> 
> # Create a list of event log names to disable
> $eventLogs = "Application", "System", "Security"
> 
> # Iterate through the list of event logs and disable them one by one
> foreach ($eventLog in $eventLogs) {
> Disable-EventLog -LogName $eventLog
> }
> 
> This script will disable the "Application", "System", and "Security" event logs on the local computer.
> There is an option to modify the list of event logs to include any other specific event log that the
> threat actor wants to disable.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > A threat actor has gained control over a Windows endpoint and has
> privileges to disable event logging by using PowerShell commands or

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üèÉüèΩ Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üñ•Ô∏è Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

 [`üîÑ Log tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Log tampering or modification

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

 [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
