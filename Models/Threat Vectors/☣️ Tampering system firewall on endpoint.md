## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> The firewall is a foundational defensive mechanism designed to control inbound and 
> outbound network traffic based on predefined security rules. By disabling 
> or tampering with these rules, adversaries effectively remove a key layer of network 
> segmentation and monitoring. This action can allow them to pivot laterally, exfiltrate 
> data without triggering alerts, or execute follow-on attacks with minimal interference 
> from host-based defenses.  
> 
> ## Windows 
> 
> An attacker with administrative privileges may execute commands such as 
> `netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off` or directly manipulate registry keys :
> (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy`) 
> to turn off or weaken firewall profiles. 
> They may also employ PowerShell scripts or WMI-based methods to silently adjust rules.  
> 
> ## Linux 
> 
> Threat actors might run commands like :
> `iptables -F` (flush all rules), `iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT`, 
> or tamper with `/etc/iptables.rules` files to ensure that all traffic is allowed. 
> 
> On some distributions, adjusting systemd firewall services or security daemons 
> can achieve the same effect.  
> 
> ## macOS
> 
> Attackers could use the `pfctl` command (e.g., `sudo pfctl -d`) to disable the 
> Packet Filter firewall, or modify system configuration files that govern firewall rules. 
> They may also exploit launch daemons or kernel extensions to bypass 
> or remove firewall protections.  
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversary must have administrative privileges on the targeted operating system 
> with the necessary permissions to modify system firewall configurations.

| UNC1878             | UNC1878 is a financially motivated threat actor that monetizes network access via the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Earlier this year, Mandiant published a blog on a fast-moving adversary deploying RYUK ransomware, UNC1878. Shortly after its release, there was a significant decrease in observed UNC1878 intrusions and RYUK activity overall almost completely vanishing over the summer. But beginning in early fall, Mandiant has seen a resurgence of RYUK along with TTP overlaps indicating that UNC1878 has returned from the grave and resumed their operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üèÉüèΩ Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üî• Firewall`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Network - Firewall
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` macOS` : Placeholder
 - ` Linux` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üî• Substantial incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a medium-sized organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a large organisation or wider / local government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`‚õî Denial of Service`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action attempting to deny access to valid users, such as by making a web server temporarily unavailable or unusable.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`üí≤ Operating costs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Increased operating costs
 - [`‚öñÔ∏è Legal and regulatory`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Legal and regulatory costs

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
