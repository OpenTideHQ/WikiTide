## 👁️ Description

> Credential manipulation on a local Windows endpoint refers to an act of
> modifying, altering, or stealing sensitive information such as usernames,
> passwords, and other authentication data.   
> 
> An example of credential manipulation could be the usage of a tool, for
> example like Mimikatz to extract login credentials from memory or to
> manipulate and modify existing credentials stored on the local system.
> The threat actor could use these manipulated credentials to gain
> unauthorized access to other systems or network resources.   
> 
> The threat actors abuse and some legitimate administrator tools, such as
> the Microsoft Sysinternals tool: ProcDump or Task Manager to dump lsass.exe
> process memory and to collect credentials. This approach is common and
> known as "living-off-the-land", which means usage of legit native Windows
> tools in order to avoid possible detection.   
> 
> Threat actors can gather, modify or delete credentials on the local Windows
> system also by using Windows Explorer manually or with scrips to access
> local files that may store user's or system credentials. For example
> Keepass or other local databases which contain passwords.   
> 
> Examples:   
> 
> Threat actors are using Mimikatz LSADUMP Module to collect SAM registry
> hashes.   
> 
> lsadump::sam   
> 
> Or to extract credentials from LSASS Dump files. 
> Mimikatz module lsass.exe dumps credentials in a more stealthy mode.
> The lsass.exe process manages many user credential secrets and can be
> associated with credential theft behavior.   
> 
> sekurlsa::minidump lsass.dmp
> log lsass.txt
> sekurlsa::logonPasswords   
> 
> For extracting of Domain Controller cached credentials is used LSADUMP module:
> lsadump::cache   
> 
> Locally, the threat actors can run sekurlsa Mimikatz module to obtain logon
> credentials:   
> 
> sekurlsa::Minidump lsassdump.dmp
> sekurlsa::logonPasswords   
> 
> Built-in Windows tools such as comsvcs.dll can also be used:   
> 
> rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll MiniDump PID lsass.dmp full   
> 
> There are variety of different tools that the threat actors use for
> memory dump, for example:   
> 
> - Taskmgr.exe
> - ProcDump
> - ProcessExplorer.exe
> - Process Hacker
> - SQLDumper
> - PowerSploit – Out-MiniDump
> - VM Memory Dump Files
> - Hibernation Files

| MuddyWater                 | The MuddyWater attacks are primarily against Middle Eastern nations. However, we have also observed attacks against surrounding nations and beyond, including targets in India and the USA. MuddyWater attacks are characterized by the use of a slowly evolving PowerShell-based first stage backdoor we call “POWERSTATS”. Despite broad scrutiny and reports on MuddyWater attacks, the activity continues with only incremental changes to the tools and techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | TEMP.Zagros, Static Kitten, Seedworm, MERCURY, COBALT ULSTER, G0069, ATK51, Boggy Serpens, Mango Sandstorm, TA450, Earth Vetala | 🌌 MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

| RedDelta                   | Likely Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group RedDelta targeting organizations within Europe and Southeast Asia using a customized variant of the PlugX backdoor. Since at least 2019, RedDelta has been consistently active within Southeast Asia, particularly in Myanmar and Vietnam, but has also routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical events. This is historically evident through the group’s targeting of the Vatican and other Catholic organizations in the lead-up to 2021 talks between Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Vatican officials, as well as throughout 2022 through the group’s shift towards increased targeting of European government and diplomatic entities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.During the 3-month period from September through November 2022, RedDelta has regularly used an infection chain employing malicious shortcut (LNK) files, which trigger a dynamic-link library (DLL) search-order-hijacking execution chain to load consistently updated PlugX versions. Throughout this period, the group repeatedly employed decoy documents specific to government and migration policy within Europe. Of note, we identified a European government department focused on trade communicating with RedDelta command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in early August 2022. This activity commenced on the same day that a RedDelta PlugX sample using this C2 infrastructure and featuring an EU trade-themed decoy document surfaced on public malware repositories. We also identified additional probable victim entities within Myanmar and Vietnam regularly communicating with RedDelta C2 infrastructure.RedDelta closely overlaps with public industry reporting under the aliases BRONZE PRESIDENT, Mustang Panda, TA416, Red Lich, and HoneyMyte. |                                                                                                                                 | 🌌 MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`🔑 Credential Access`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques resulting in the access of, or control over, system, service or domain credentials.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `🏢 Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `☁️ Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `☁️ Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`🖥️ Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation
 - [`💻 Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`👤 End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`🖥️ Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🖲️ Control Server`](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Control_Server) : A device which acts as both a server and controller, that hosts the control software used in communicating with lower-level control devices in an ICS network (e.g. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)).
 - [`👤 System admin`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Administrator
 - [`🖥️ Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🖥️ Web Application Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Active Directory` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`🧨 Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

 [`🐒 Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

 [`😤 Nuisance`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Small and mostly inconsequential to day to day operations, but noticed.

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
