## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> The `FileFix` technique is a new social engineering method similar to
> `ClickFix` attack. `FileFix` is used by the threat actors to abuse Windows
> Explorer and execute malicious commands on a compromised system. This
> technique takes advantage of the Windows Explorer feature that allows users
> to specify a custom executable to open a file with. The goal of this
> technique is to harvest user's credentials. Threat actor can execute
> commands through the user's Windows Explorer and deploy further a loader
> which drops infostealer, harvesting browsers, wallets and cloud credentials
> ref [1],[2].
> 
> Unlike `ClickFix`, which tricks users into running malicious commands via
> the Windows Run dialog, `FileFix` takes a subtler approach: A malicious
> webpage will open a legitimate File Explorer window while covertly copying
> a disguised PowerShell one-liner into the clipboard. The user is then asked
> to paste into the Explorer address bar (or otherwise paste into a UI), and
> the pasted content runs in the user context, often invoking PowerShell to
> download and execute follow-on payloads ref [1].  
> 
> ### How FileFix Works
> 
> - User Interaction: The attack typically begins when a user is lured to a
>   compromised website that prompts them to perform actions that seem benign, 
>   such as opening File Explorer to access a shared document.
> - Clipboard Manipulation: The website uses JavaScript to copy a malicious
>   PowerShell command to the clipboard while simultaneously opening a File
>   Explorer window.
> - Execution: The user is instructed to paste the clipboard content into the
>   File Explorer address bar, which leads to the execution of the malicious
>   command.
> 
> To the victims, this process appears to be a simple task of opening a shared
> file or folder, making it feel routine and safe. This subtle manipulation
> makes `FileFix` a more stealthy and potentially more dangerous evolution of
> the `ClickFix` social engineering attack. 
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > The attack requires Windows hosts with interactive users who have the
> ability to open File Explorer or paste into the Explorer address bar.
> The browser must allow JavaScript to run (standard), and the victim must
> be able to interactively paste content from the clipboard into the Explorer
> address bar or other UI (e.g., Run dialog).

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîë Credential Access`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques resulting in the access of, or control over, system, service or domain credentials.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üë§ Customer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Customer
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` PowerShell` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`ü§¨ Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
