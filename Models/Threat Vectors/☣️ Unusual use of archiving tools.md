## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Threat actors often use legitimate archiving tools, like 7-Zip, WinRAR or tar, 
> to compress and exfiltrate data from compromised systems. Attackers rename 
> these executables or use the executables in ways that are atypical to evade 
> security measures that would normally rely on standard file names 
> or typical usage patterns.
> 
> Example : an attacker renaming 7z.exe to system32.exe and saving it in a
> directory that is abnormal. They can then run the following command:
> C:\Users\Public\system32.exe a -tzip C:\Users\Public\archive.zip C:\SensitiveData\*
> 
> This technique enables the attacker to archive sensitive data in a manner 
> that would make the activity seem benign. The unusual locations of archive file 
> creation and the usage of archiving tools with non-standard naming are 
> the indicators of potentially malicious activity.
> 
> Also, a significant number of data compression and unusual outbound network traffic 
> may indicate attempts to exfiltrate data.



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversary must have access to systems with archiving tools installed and permissions 
> to execute renamed or custom archiving utilities.

| [ICS] FIN7           | [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) is a financially-motivated threat group that has been active since 2013. [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) has primarily targeted the retail, restaurant, hospitality, software, consulting, financial services, medical equipment, cloud services, media, food and beverage, transportation, and utilities industries in the U.S. A portion of [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) was run out of a front company called Combi Security and often used point-of-sale malware for targeting efforts. Since 2020, [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) shifted operations to a big game hunting (BGH) approach including use of [REvil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0496) ransomware and their own Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Darkside. FIN7 may be linked to the [Carbanak](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0008) Group, but there appears to be several groups using [Carbanak](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0030) malware and are therefore tracked separately.(Citation: FireEye FIN7 March 2017)(Citation: FireEye FIN7 April 2017)(Citation: FireEye CARBANAK June 2017)(Citation: FireEye FIN7 Aug 2018)(Citation: CrowdStrike Carbon Spider August 2021)(Citation: Mandiant FIN7 Apr 2022)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Carbon Spider, ELBRUS, GOLD NIAGARA, ITG14, Sangria Tempest                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | üó°Ô∏è MITRE ATT&CK Groups     | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üèÉüèΩ Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` macOS` : Placeholder
 - ` Linux` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`‚ú® Modify data`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify stored data or content

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
