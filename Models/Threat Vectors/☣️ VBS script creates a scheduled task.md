## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Threat actors often use Visual Basic Scripting (VBS) to create scheduled
> tasks on compromised Windows systems. VBS is a built-in scripting language
> on Windows systems, making it an attractive choice for threat actors. It
> allows the threat actors to execute code without relying on external tools
> or binaries, reducing the risk of detection.    
> 
> Once executed by the victim, the VBScript establishes persistence on
> infected machines by creating scheduled tasks and modifying the Windows
> Registry.
> 
> ### Creating a scheduled task using a VBS script
> 
> To create a scheduled task using VBS, threat actors typically follow the
> steps provided below:
> 1. An initial VBS script creation - the attacker creates a VBS script that
> contains the malicious code. This script can be embedded in an email
> attachment, downloaded from a compromised website, or created locally on
> the compromised system.  
> 2. The created VBS script uses `schtasks` - the VBS script uses the
> `schtasks` to create a new scheduled task. The `SchTasks` command is a
> built-in Windows utility that allows users to create, delete, and manage
> scheduled tasks.
> 3. Task details: The VBS script specifies the task details, including the
> task name, description, and the command or script to be executed.
> 4. Set a task trigger - the VBS script may set a task trigger, which defines
> when the task should be executed. This can be a specific time, daily,
> weekly, or on system startup.
> 5. A task preservation - the VBS scrip
> 
> ### Some of the techniques used to achieve VBS persistence and
> obfuscation
> 
> - Obfuscation: Threat actors often obfuscate their VBS scripts to evade
> detection by security software. They use techniques like random variable
> names, fake function calls or garbage code to hide the function of the
> malicious code.  
> 
> - Scheduled task chaining: Threat actors create as tasks under the current
> user or if allowed under SYSTEM to elevate privileges and maintain foothold
> onto the system.  
> 
> ### An example for a VBS script which creates a scheduled task
> 
> Below is given an example of a VBS (Visual Basic Scripting) script that
> creates a scheduled task to run a command or application at a specified
> time. This script uses the Windows Task Scheduler to schedule the task.  
> 
> ```visualbasic
> 
> ' Create a new task
> Dim sch, task
> Set sch = CreateObject("Schedule.Service")
> sch.Connect()
> 
> ' Define the task
> Dim taskDefinition
> Set taskDefinition = sch.CreateNewTask(0)
> 
> ' Set task registration info
> taskDefinition.RegistrationInfo.Description = "This is a test task created by VBS script"
> taskDefinition.RegistrationInfo.Author = "Your Name"
> 
> ' Set task principal (who runs the task)
> Dim principal
> Set principal = taskDefinition.Principal
> principal.LogonType = 3 ' Interactive or 3 for S4U
> principal.UserId = "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" ' You can change this to a different user
> 
> ' Set task trigger (when to run the task)
> Dim trigger
> Set trigger = taskDefinition.Triggers.Create(_
> TaskTriggerType2.Daily)
> trigger.StartTime = "08:00:00" ' 8 AM daily
> trigger.Id = "DailyTrigger"
> 
> ' Set task action (what to run)
> Dim action
> Set action = taskDefinition.Actions.Create(_
> TaskActionType.Exec)
> action.Path = "C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe" ' Path to the application to run
> action.Arguments = "" ' Arguments if any
> 
> ' Register the task
> Dim taskFolder
> Set taskFolder = sch.GetFolder("\")
> taskFolder.RegisterTaskDefinition "TestVBS Task", taskDefinition, 6, , , 3, , , task
> 
> ```

| [ICS] FIN7          | [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) is a financially-motivated threat group that has been active since 2013. [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) has primarily targeted the retail, restaurant, hospitality, software, consulting, financial services, medical equipment, cloud services, media, food and beverage, transportation, and utilities industries in the U.S. A portion of [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) was run out of a front company called Combi Security and often used point-of-sale malware for targeting efforts. Since 2020, [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) shifted operations to a big game hunting (BGH) approach including use of [REvil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0496) ransomware and their own Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Darkside.

| Lazarus Group       | Since 2009, HIDDEN COBRA actors have leveraged their capabilities to target and compromise a range of victims; some intrusions have resulted in the exfiltration of data while others have been disruptive in nature.

| APT29               | A 2015 report by F-Secure describe APT29 as: 'The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. The Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States;Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments;organizations associated with Chechen extremism;and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large - scale spear - phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash - and - grab approach involving a fast but noisy breakin followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible.If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long - term intelligence gathering. This threat actor targets government ministries and agencies in the West, Central Asia, East Africa, and the Middle East; Chechen extremist groups; Russian organized crime; and think tanks. It is suspected to be behind the 2015 compromise of unclassified networks at the White House, Department of State, Pentagon, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The threat actor includes all of the Dukes tool sets, including MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, SeaDuke, CloudDuke (aka MiniDionis), and HammerDuke (aka Hammertoss).

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîê Persistence`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üë§ Customer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Customer
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [` Other`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Media - Other/Unknown
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üïπÔ∏è Remote access`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Remote access

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Windows` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`ü§¨ Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
