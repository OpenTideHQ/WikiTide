## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> GSM interception refers to the unauthorized capture and monitoring of communications 
> (calls, SMS, and sometimes data) transmitted over GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) 
> networks. This threat vector exploits inherent weaknesses in the GSM protocol, outdated 
> encryption algorithms, and the ability to impersonate legitimate network infrastructure.
> 
> ## How GSM interception works
> 
> **Key Techniques:**
> 
> - **IMSI Catchers (Fake Base Stations):** Attackers deploy rogue base stations 
> (often called IMSI catchers or Stingrays) that mimic legitimate cell towers. Mobile 
> devices in the vicinity connect to these fake towers, allowing attackers to capture 
> the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), track users, and intercept communications.
> 
> - **Weak Encryption Algorithms:** Early GSM encryption standards, such as A5/1 and 
> A5/2, are now considered weak and can be cracked with modest resources. Attackers 
> can eavesdrop on calls and SMS by decrypting intercepted radio signals.
> 
> - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** By placing themselves between the mobile 
> device and the legitimate network, attackers can intercept, alter, or inject communications, 
> often without the user‚Äôs knowledge.
> 
> - **Signaling Exploits:** Vulnerabilities in GSM‚Äôs signaling protocols (like SS7) 
> can be abused to redirect calls or SMS messages to an attacker, enabling interception 
> even if the attacker is not physically near the target.
> 
> ## Threat impact
> 
> - **Eavesdropping:** Attackers can listen to phone calls and read SMS messages, 
> compromising user privacy and potentially exposing sensitive or confidential information.
> 
> - **Location Tracking:** By capturing IMSI and other identifiers, attackers can 
> track a user‚Äôs movements in real time.
> 
> - **Data Manipulation:** In MitM scenarios, attackers can alter messages or inject 
> malicious content during transmission.
> 
> - **Fraud and Identity Theft:** Intercepted communications can be used for social 
> engineering, phishing, or unauthorized access to accounts (e.g., intercepting SMS-based 
> two-factor authentication).
> 
> ## Real-world examples
> 
> - **Commercial Surveillance Devices:** Commercially available devices can intercept 
> GSM traffic, extract encryption keys, and monitor communications. These devices 
> are used by law enforcement, intelligence agencies, and sometimes by criminals to 
> conduct surveillance or steal information.
> 
> - **Notorious Attacks:** There have been documented cases where attackers used GSM 
> interception to gain access to bank accounts by intercepting SMS-based authentication codes.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversaries need specialized hardware such as passive or active GSM interceptors 
> (e.g., IMSI catchers, fake base stations). These devices can mimic legitimate cell 
> towers and force nearby mobile phones to connect, enabling interception of communications.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üóÉÔ∏è Collection`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques used to identify and gather data from a target network prior to exfiltration.

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üì± Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`ü¶† Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`ü©π Hardware tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Hardware tampering or physical alteration
 - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`üò§ Nuisance`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Small and mostly inconsequential to day to day operations, but noticed.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
