## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> TOAD (Telephone-Oriented Attack Delivery) and BEC (Business Email Compromise) attacks 
> are sophisticated forms of social engineering that pose significant threats to organizations. 
> These attacks often bypass traditional email security measures by avoiding the use 
> of malicious attachments or URLs.    
> 
> ## TOAD Attacks    
> 
> TOAD attacks combine email and voice phishing techniques to trick victims into disclosing 
> sensitive information or transferring funds.    
> 
> Key characteristics of TOAD attacks:    
> 
> - Initial contact via email, urging the recipient to call a phone number
> - No malicious attachments or URLs in the email
> - Social engineering tactics used during phone conversations
> - Often impersonate legitimate brands or authority figures    
> 
> ## BEC Attacks    
> 
> BEC attacks involve impersonating or compromising legitimate email accounts to deceive 
> individuals into sharing sensitive information or transferring funds.    
> 
> Key characteristics of BEC attacks:    
> 
> - Highly targeted and personalized emails
> - Often impersonate executives, vendors, or trusted partners
> - Create a sense of urgency
> - Rarely include malicious payloads
> - Frequently target Accounts Payable teams

| Lazarus Group | Since 2009, HIDDEN COBRA actors have leveraged their capabilities to target and compromise a range of victims; some intrusions have resulted in the exfiltration of data while others have been disruptive in nature. Commercial reporting has referred to this activity as Lazarus Group and Guardians of Peace. Tools and capabilities used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include DDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and wiper malware. Variants of malware and tools used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include Destover, Duuzer, and Hangman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Operation DarkSeoul, Dark Seoul, Hidden Cobra, Hastati Group, Andariel, Unit 121, Bureau 121, NewRomanic Cyber Army Team, Bluenoroff, Subgroup: Bluenoroff, Group 77, Labyrinth Chollima, Operation Troy, Operation GhostSecret, Operation AppleJeus, APT38, APT 38, Stardust Chollima, Whois Hacking Team, Zinc, Appleworm, Nickel Academy, APT-C-26, NICKEL GLADSTONE, COVELLITE, ATK3, G0032, ATK117, G0082, Citrine Sleet, DEV-0139, DEV-1222, Diamond Sleet, ZINC, Sapphire Sleet, COPERNICIUM, TA404, Lazarus group, BeagleBoyz, Moonstone Sleet | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`ü™ù Social Engineering`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques aimed at the manipulation of people to perform unsafe actions.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `üï∏Ô∏è SaaS` : Subscription based access to software.
 - `üì± Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.
 - `üåê Networking` : Communications backbone connecting users, applications and machines.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üìß Email Platform`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`ü™™ Personal Information`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`ü™£ Cloud Storage Accounts`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üì± Mobile phone`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Mobile phone or smartphone

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` AWS` : Placeholder
 - ` Azure` : Placeholder
 - ` Office 365` : Placeholder
 - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` macOS` : Placeholder
 - ` Android` : Placeholder
 - ` iOS` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üí± Fraudulent transaction`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Initiate fraudulent transaction
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üí∏ Monetary Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : The vector will directly conduct to loss of value directly impacting the bottom line.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
