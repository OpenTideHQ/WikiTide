## 👁️ Description

> Spearphishing messages are often crafted using pernicious social engineering
> techniques.
> 
> In Spearphishing Attachment attacks, recipients receive emails that contain
> malicious attachments. The email message entices users to open the
> attachment(s) using the knowlege gained.
> 
> - displayed sender name is known by the recipient
> - topic/subject is in the field of activity of the recipient
> - urgency of user action (less relevant TTP for spearphishing emails)
> 
> These attachments look like valid files. In some cases, they are disguised
> as MS Office, PDF files or CV files ref [5]. It could be that the attacker
> manage to capture a legit document, weaponise it and send it to (new)
> recipients (it has been observed that such attack can occur within tens of
> minutes after the original legit document was released). In addition, there
> have also been reports of TAMs sending malicious PowerPoint (PPSX) files
> that exploit vulnerabilities and emails with Word document attachments that
> do not require macros to be enabled in order to execute.  
> 
> Attachments may:
> 
> - contain links leading to a page for credential harvesting.
> - be weaponized to install malicious software on the computer of the user or
> run some actions on the device;
> - or open a decoy document. This is quite frequent in attack conducted by TA
> when the malware within the attachment makes some check and assess that the
> was not opened on the targeted organisation. Decoy document are meant to
> evade detection and avoid raising alert or recipient report to cyber
> security team, such as emails with attached Word documents that do not
> require enabling macros to execute.
> 
> ## Common techniques to evade detection
> 
> Attackers may use several way to try to hide visually the true nature of
> the file.
> 
> ### Double extensions
> 
> Attackers may use double extensions to masquerade the true file type to 
> trick users into opening files that might seem safe. But this TTP is quite
> well addressed at front email gateway (blocking by default file with several
> extension, usually also when within a compressed file). 
> 
> ### Password-protected attachment
> 
> Malicious password-protected archive files are designed to deceive users
> and bypass commonly deployed inspection engines to deliver malware and 
> ransomware down to a user endpoint. If the Email Security tool detects a
> password-protected attachment, it will scan the metadata of the file;
> not the content.
> 
> ### Right-to-Left Override (RLTO)
> 
> Another technique is to hide the real file extension is Right-to-Left 
> Override (RLTO). Windows supports languages that are written from right 
> to left using a Unicode character that causes the text that follows it 
> to be displayed in reverse, this method is used to blend the real file 
> extension with the file name.

## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > Spear phishing requires more preparation and time to achieve success 
> than a phishing attack. That is because spear-phishing attackers
> attempt to obtain vast amounts of personal information about their
> victims.  
> Attackers can get the personal information they need using different
> ways:  
> - to compromise an email or messaging system trough other means,
> - to use OSINT, sourcing Social Media or glean personal information
> from the user's online presence.
> They want to craft emails that look as legitimate and attractive as possible 
> to increase the chances of fooling their targets, for instance sending a malicious 
> attachment where the filename references a topic the recipient is interested in.
> The highly personalized nature of spear-phishing attacks makes it more 
> difficult to identity than widescale phishing attacks.

| UNC1878                      | UNC1878 is a financially motivated threat actor that monetizes network access via the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Earlier this year, Mandiant published a blog on a fast-moving adversary deploying RYUK ransomware, UNC1878. Shortly after its release, there was a significant decrease in observed UNC1878 intrusions and RYUK activity overall almost completely vanishing over the summer. But beginning in early fall, Mandiant has seen a resurgence of RYUK along with TTP overlaps indicating that UNC1878 has returned from the grave and resumed their operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 🌌 MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

| Gamaredon Group              | Unit 42 threat researchers have recently observed a threat group distributing new, custom developed malware. We have labelled this threat group the Gamaredon Group and our research shows that the Gamaredon Group has been active since at least 2013.  In the past, the Gamaredon Group has relied heavily on off-the-shelf tools. Our new research shows the Gamaredon Group have made a shift to custom-developed malware. We believe this shift indicates the Gamaredon Group have improved their technical capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ACTINIUM, DEV-0157, Blue Otso, BlueAlpha, G0047, IRON TILDEN, PRIMITIVE BEAR, Shuckworm, Trident Ursa, UAC-0010, Winterflounder, Aqua Blizzard, Actinium                                                                                                                                                  | 🌌 MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

| RedDelta                     | Likely Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group RedDelta targeting organizations within Europe and Southeast Asia using a customized variant of the PlugX backdoor. Since at least 2019, RedDelta has been consistently active within Southeast Asia, particularly in Myanmar and Vietnam, but has also routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical events. This is historically evident through the group’s targeting of the Vatican and other Catholic organizations in the lead-up to 2021 talks between Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Vatican officials, as well as throughout 2022 through the group’s shift towards increased targeting of European government and diplomatic entities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.During the 3-month period from September through November 2022, RedDelta has regularly used an infection chain employing malicious shortcut (LNK) files, which trigger a dynamic-link library (DLL) search-order-hijacking execution chain to load consistently updated PlugX versions. Throughout this period, the group repeatedly employed decoy documents specific to government and migration policy within Europe. Of note, we identified a European government department focused on trade communicating with RedDelta command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in early August 2022. This activity commenced on the same day that a RedDelta PlugX sample using this C2 infrastructure and featuring an EU trade-themed decoy document surfaced on public malware repositories. We also identified additional probable victim entities within Myanmar and Vietnam regularly communicating with RedDelta C2 infrastructure.RedDelta closely overlaps with public industry reporting under the aliases BRONZE PRESIDENT, Mustang Panda, TA416, Red Lich, and HoneyMyte. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 🌌 MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`📦 Delivery`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `🏢 Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `📱 Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.
 - `☁️ Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `☁️ Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`📧 Email Platform`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`👤 End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`👤 Customer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Customer
 - [`📑 Documents`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Media - Documents

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Office 365` : Placeholder
 - ` Android` : Placeholder
 - ` iOS` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`👻 Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user’s credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`📦 Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification
 - [`💅 Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`👁️‍🗨️ Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`💀 Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🌍 Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`🥸 Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`🛑 Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
