## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> An employee named receives an email that appears to be from a trusted business 
> partner or colleague. The email contains an office document. The end-user clic on it.
> 
> The attached file, is a macro-enabled Word document. It usually pops-up with 
> the following message :
> "This document was created in an earlier version of Microsoft Word. 
> Please click 'Enable Content' above to view the full document."
> 
> This message is designed to entice end-user to enable macros or active content, 
> which is disabled by default for security reasons.
> 
> By clicking ont it, it allows the embedded macro, written in 
> Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), to execute without further prompts.
> 
> Once executed, the macro initiates a hidden process that launches Windows PowerShell, 
> which run:
> 
> - Run silently without displaying a window to the user.
> - Bypass execution policies that normally restrict script running.
> - Connect to an external server controlled by the attacker.
> - Download and execute additional malicious code or a payload.
> 
> Threat actors may also modify Windows Registry settings related to 
> Microsoft Office security.
> 
> - Disabling the COM Kill Bit: This involves changing registry values 
> that control the activation of certain COM objects or ActiveX controls 
> within Office applications. By disabling the "kill bit," the threat actor 
> re-enables outdated or vulnerable components that can be exploited.
> 
> - Altering Macro Security Settings: Changing registry keys to lower the 
> macro security level, allowing macros to run without prompts in the future.
> 
> To maintain long-term access to the compromised system, 
> the attacker may target Microsoft Outlook.
> 
> - Embedding Malicious Code in Outlook's VBA Project:
> - The attacker adds VBA code to Outlook's VbaProject.otm file.
> This code executes every time Outlook starts, performing actions without the user's knowledge.



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Target systems must have Microsoft Office applications installed with macros 
> enabled or be susceptible to social engineering tactics that prompt users 
> to enable macros or execute malicious content.

| UNC1878             | UNC1878 is a financially motivated threat actor that monetizes network access via the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Earlier this year, Mandiant published a blog on a fast-moving adversary deploying RYUK ransomware, UNC1878. Shortly after its release, there was a significant decrease in observed UNC1878 intrusions and RYUK activity overall almost completely vanishing over the summer. But beginning in early fall, Mandiant has seen a resurgence of RYUK along with TTP overlaps indicating that UNC1878 has returned from the grave and resumed their operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

That is because spear-phishing attackers attempt to obtain vast amounts of personal information about their victims.   Attackers can get the personal information they need using different ways:   - to compromise an email or messaging system trough other means, - to use OSINT, sourcing Social Media or glean personal information from the user's online presence. They want to craft emails that look as legitimate and attractive as possible  to increase the chances of fooling their targets, for instance sending a malicious  attachment where the filename references a topic the recipient is interested in.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`‚ö° Execution`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üìß Email Platform`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üóÉÔ∏è Critical Documents`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`ü™™ Personal Information`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Office 365` : Placeholder
 - [` Microsoft SharePoint`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/) : Microsoft SharePoint is a cloud-based service that helps organizations share and manage content, knowledge, and applications
 - [` Outlook Web Access`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/troubleshoot/client-connectivity/set-up-web-access) : Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App or Outlook Web Access) is a browser-based email client. Outlook on the web lets you access your Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox from almost any web browser.

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üì¶ Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üò∞ Very Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Highly probable - 80-95%
