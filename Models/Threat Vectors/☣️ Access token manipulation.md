## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> ### Access token:
> 
> An access token is part of the logon session of the user, and it also contains their credentials for
> Windows single sign on (SSO) authentication to access local or remote network services.
> 
> When a user signs on to a machine ((irrespective of the logon type), the system generates an 
> access token for them. With this access token, Windows handles the user identification,
> security, and access rights on the system.
> 
> ### Access token manipulation:
> 
> An attacker can manipulate access tokens to make a process appear to be initiated by a different
> user account, when in reality, the request was originated by the account of the attacker.
> 
> Attackers use access tokens to escalate privileges from administrative to SYSTEM level,
> allowing them to undertake malicious operations and remotely access systems in the corporate network.
> 
> ### Manipulating access token by injecting malware:
> 
> - If the current logged-on user on the compromised or infected machine is a member of the administrator
>   group of users or is running a process with higher privileges (e.g., by using the ‚Äúrunas‚Äù command),
>   malware can take advantage of the privileges of the process‚Äôs access token to elevate its privileges
>   on the system, allowing it to perform privileged tasks.
> 
> - Malware can enumerate the Windows processes running with higher privileges (typically SYSTEM level privileges),
>   obtain the access tokens for those processes, and utilise the acquired token to launch new processes.
>   As a result, the new process is launched in the context of the SYSTEM user, as represented by the token.
> 
> - Malware can also perform a token impersonation attack, in which it copies the access tokens of higher-level
>   SYSTEM processes, converts them into impersonation tokens using appropriate Windows functionality, 
>   and then impersonates the SYSTEM user on the infected machine, thereby elevating its privileges.
> 
> ### Methods used to manipulate access tokens:  
> 
> - Theft of access tokens.
>   An attacker can copy and use existing tokens from other processes to undertake malicious activities using 
>   the built-in Windows API functions:
>     - To make duplicate tokens of existing access tokens, utilise the DuplicateTokenEx() function.
>     - The ImpersonateLoggedOnUser() function is used to run the process as another user.
>     - Attackers can assign an impersonated token to a thread using the SetThreatToken() function.
> 
> - Using a stolen access token to create a new process.
>   Use the CreateProcessWithTokenW() function to create a new process with a duplicated token. The attackers
>   can use this function to generate tokens that implement the security context of any user they want to impersonate.
> 
> - Creating Logon sessions.
>   If an attacker has the credentials for any user account, they can use the LogonUser() function to create logon 
>   sessions for them remotely. They can then gain a token from the security context of the logged in user, 
>   which they can give to a thread to launch a process.
>

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`ü•∏ Privilege Escalation`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : The result of techniques that provide an attacker with higher permissions on a system or network.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Active Directory` : Placeholder
 - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` PowerShell` : Placeholder

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`‚ú® Modify data`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify stored data or content
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üîê New Accounts`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Ability to create new arbitrary user accounts.

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.
