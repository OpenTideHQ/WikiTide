## 👁️ Description

> The GoldPickaxe Malware Analysis provides an in-depth look at the capabilities of 
> a new iOS Trojan named GoldPickaxe.iOS, which is part of a broader suite of malware 
> developed by the Chinese-speaking cybercriminal group codenamed GoldFactory.  
> 
> GoldPickaxe.iOS is capable of collecting sensitive data, including facial recognition 
> data, identity documents, and SMS messages. The Android version, GoldPickaxe.Android, 
> shares similar functionalities. The malware exploits AI-driven face-swapping services 
> to create deepfakes, enabling unauthorized access to victims' banking accounts, 
> a novel technique in cyber theft.  
> 
> The initial distribution methods for GoldPickaxe.iOS include:
> 
> - Apple's TestFlight platform, where they trick users to download a TestFlight
>   app from hxxps://testflight.apple[.]com/join/<ID>.
> 
> - Use of social engineering to install a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile on
>   user devices, granting them full control. At any time only one MDM profile can
>   be active, but to have several MDM profiles installed in the device is possible.  
> 
> The infection chain involves several steps, including receiving a link that leads 
> to a fraudulent website, being prompted to install an MDM profile, and granting 
> the adversaries control over the device. Once installed, the malware can perform
> various malicious activities, including tracking, remote wiping, and installing
> additional apps without the user's consent.  
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > Adversaries must have a well-crafted phishing or smishing campaign that impersonates 
> government authorities and popular messaging applications to trick victims into 
> downloading and installing the malicious MDM profile.

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`⚡ Execution`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `📱 Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

 - [`👤 Identity Services`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`📱 Mobile phone`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Mobile phone or smartphone
 - [`📱 Tablet`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Tablet

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Android` : Placeholder
 - ` iOS` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`👽 Alter behavior`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Influence or alter human behavior
 - [`🦠 Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`💅 Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`📦 Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification
 - [`👻 Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user’s credentials, such as username and password.

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🥸 Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`🧠 IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`🌍 Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
