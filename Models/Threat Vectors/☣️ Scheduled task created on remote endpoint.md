## 👁️ Description

> Adversaries with access to the right credentials can create scheduled tasks 
> remotely from an endpoint they control for malicious purposes, which often 
> include outbound connections to attacker infrastructure, binary execution, 
> achieve persistance or registry entry editing or creation, but in this case
> the remote scheduled task achieves lateral movement. 
> 
> Adversaries can create and configure scheduled tasks on remote endpoints 
> using either the task scheduler or PowerShell.
> 
> One example syntax used to create a new task on a remote computer is to 
> use \computername
> 
> Examples: 
> 
> at \\computername time/interactive | /every: date, ... /next: date, ... command
> at \\computername id/delete | /delete /yes
> 
> Run a scheduled task on a remote mashine using PowerShell, example:
> 
> schtasks /run /s ComputerName /tn “description”
> 
> Using the task Scheduler, as example: > "Connect to Another Computer", 
> provide the IP address of the remote system and select "Connect as another 
> user" > "Set User".
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > Threat actor uses an already compromised Windows endpoint. Requires administrative 
> credentials with permissions for remote task creation. Requires that
> Windows firewall on the remote endpoint allows “Remote Scheduled Tasks 
> Management”).

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`🔐 Persistence`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `🏢 Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `☁️ Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`🖥️ Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🖲️ Control Server`](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Control_Server) : A device which acts as both a server and controller, that hosts the control software used in communicating with lower-level control devices in an ICS network (e.g. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)).
 - [`🖲️ Input/Output Server`](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Input/Output_Server) : The Input/Output (I/O) server provides the interface between the control system LAN applications and the field equipment monitored and controlled by the control system applications. The I/O server, sometimes referred to as a Front-End Processor (FEP) or Data Acquisition Server (DAS), converts the control system application data into packets that are transmitted over various types of communications media to the end device locations. The I/O server also converts data received from the various end devices over different communications mediums into data formatted to communicate with the control system networked applications.

 - [`🖥️ Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`🧨 Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`🦠 Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`💀 Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`⚙️ Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`📦 Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

 [`🩼 Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
