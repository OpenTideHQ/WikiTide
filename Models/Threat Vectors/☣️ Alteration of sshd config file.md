## 👁️ Description

> This threat vector highlights the risk associated with unauthorized access or 
> alteration of the `sshd_config` file on Linux systems. Adversaries who manage 
> to gain elevated privileges (root or sudo) can modify SSH service parameters 
> in `sshd_config` to allow additional keys, redirect ports, or weaken 
> authentication requirements.  
> 
> Possible scenario done by a threat actor :
> 
> ### Adding Rogue SSH Keys
> An attacker with root or sudo privileges could append a malicious public key to 
> the authorized_keys directive in sshd_config. For instance:
> 
> ```bash
> echo "AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/my_malicious_keys" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
> ```
> They might then place their public key in that file. This allows them to log in 
> via SSH without needing a password, often bypassing standard detection.  
> 
> ### Enabling Root Login
> If an organization has wisely disabled direct root login, an attacker could revert 
> that setting in sshd_config:
> 
> ```bash
> sed -i 's/^#PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
> ```
> By doing so, they allow themselves to authenticate as root directly.  
> 
> ### Allowing Password Authentication
> In secure environments, SSH often requires key-based authentication. 
> An attacker might weaken this by enabling password-based access and choosing 
> easy-to-guess credentials:
> 
> ```bash
> sed -i 's/^PasswordAuthentication.*/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
> ```
> Once changed, brute-force or credential-stuffing techniques become more feasible, 
> helping the adversary maintain illicit access.  
> 
> ### Redirecting SSH Ports
> Defenders commonly monitor TCP port 22 for suspicious activities. An attacker 
> could modify sshd_config to run SSH on a high or less-monitored port:
> 
> ```bash
> sed -i 's/^Port 22/Port 2222/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
> ```
> This tactic helps attackers blend into legitimate traffic patterns or bypass 
> perimeter defenses that only monitor the default SSH port.  
> 
> ### Creating Hidden Backdoors
> Attackers may add an additional Match block in sshd_config that grants special 
> privileges to a specific user or from a specific IP range:
> 
> ```bash
> echo "Match User hiddenuser
>     X11Forwarding yes
>     AllowTcpForwarding yes" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
> ```
> This configuration could stealthily enable features like port forwarding, 
> further helping attackers evade detection and maintain persistence.  
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > Threat actor must have root or sudo privileges on the target Linux system, 
> as well as the ability to interact with sshd_config 
> (e.g., via nano, vim, vi, or cat commands), before this threat is realized.

| UNC1878              | UNC1878 is a financially motivated threat actor that monetizes network access via the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Earlier this year, Mandiant published a blog on a fast-moving adversary deploying RYUK ransomware, UNC1878. Shortly after its release, there was a significant decrease in observed UNC1878 intrusions and RYUK activity overall almost completely vanishing over the summer. But beginning in early fall, Mandiant has seen a resurgence of RYUK along with TTP overlaps indicating that UNC1878 has returned from the grave and resumed their operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                    | 🌌 MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

| TeamTNT              | In early Febuary, 2021 TeamTNT launched a new campaign against Docker and Kubernetes environments. Using a collection of container images that are hosted in Docker Hub, the attackers are targeting misconfigured docker daemons, Kubeflow dashboards, and Weave Scope, exploiting these environments in order to steal cloud credentials, open backdoors, mine cryptocurrency, and launch a worm that is looking for the next victim.They're linked to the First Crypto-Mining Worm to Steal AWS Credentials and Hildegard Cryptojacking malware.TeamTNT is a relatively recent addition to a growing number of threats targeting the cloud. While they employ some of the same tactics as similar groups, TeamTNT stands out with their social media presence and penchant for self-promotion. Tweets from the TeamTNT’s account are in both English and German although it is unknown if they are located in Germany.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Adept Libra                                                                                                                                                        | 🌌 MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`🔐 Persistence`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `🏢 Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`🛠️ Virtual Machines`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🖥️ Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`💻 Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Linux` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`🐒 Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`⚙️ Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`💅 Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`🛑 Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`🌍 Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
