## 👁️ Description

> WebKit is a cross-platform browser rendering engine used in Safari
> and other applications across macOS, iOS, and other platforms.
> 
> Due to Apple's restrictions, even Chromium-based browsers on iOS,
> such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, rely on WebKit, making
> them vulnerable to this exploit as well. According to Apple,
> this issue may have been exploited against specific targeted
> individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 17.23 ref [2].    
> 
> The WebKit vulnerability (CVE-2025-24201) is an out-of-bounds write 
> vulnerability and Apple notes it as a zero-day exploited remotely. 
> It allows attackers to bypass WebKit's sandbox and achieve arbitrary 
> code execution on affected devices. The vulnerability requires user
> interaction in order to be triggered. For more details ref [6].        
> 
> The vulnerability requires user interaction in order to be triggered.
> From the analysis and the information in the reports what is known until
> now is that the exploit code is not publicly available and the Webkit
> component presents in software used by multiple Union entities.   
> 
> From the available information until now, the known affected
> products are chromium-based browsers on the following platforms: 
> macOS, iOS, iPadOS ref [1], [2].  
> 
> Apple is also known for emailing affected users, despite the 
> limited amount of information on the Threat Alert, as confirmed by 
> CERT-EU, in case of exploitation detected by Apple notification 
> will be sent.

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`📨 Exfiltration`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that result or aid in an attacker removing data from a target network.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `🏢 Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `📱 Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.
 - `🦾 IoT` : Placeholder

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`👤 End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`📱 Mobile phone`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Mobile phone or smartphone
 - [` Other`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Media - Other/Unknown
 - [`🕹️ Remote access`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Remote access

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` iOS` : Placeholder
 - ` macOS` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`🧨 Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`💀 Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`💅 Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`🦠 Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`🐒 Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🩼 Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`🤬 Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.
 - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
