## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> The ‚ÄúGather Resource Data‚Äù technique is a key part of the reconnaissance phase in 
> attacks against Azure environments. This activity focuses on enumerating information 
> about resources within a target Azure tenant or subscription to support subsequent 
> attack phases.
> 
> #### Example Attack Scenario
> 
> A threat actor gains access to a compromised identity in an Azure environment, such 
> as via phishing or a leaked credential. Using this access, the attacker enumerates 
> accessible resources (e.g., virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, and identity 
> configurations) by executing read operations like `{resource}/*/read`. For example, 
> if the account has Reader or even limited permissions, the attacker can list resource 
> groups, virtual machines, Key Vaults, storage accounts, and see details such as 
> configurations, names, and metadata. They might also list the names of secrets or 
> certificates in a Key Vault‚Äîwhile unable to access the contents without elevated 
> permissions, this reconnaissance helps prioritize attack targets.
> 
> #### Attack Goals and Impact
> 
> - **Goals:**
>   - Develop a comprehensive map of the organization‚Äôs Azure environment.
>   - Identify high-value resources (e.g., storage accounts with sensitive data, Key 
>   Vaults, privileged identities).
>   - Find weakly configured, over-permitted, or exposed resources (public endpoints, 
>   misconfigured access policies).
>   - Inform next stages of the attack (privilege escalation, lateral movement, data theft).
> 
> - **Potential Impact:**
>   - **Accelerated compromise:** With detailed resource and configuration information, 
>   attackers can quickly focus on the most lucrative or vulnerable targets.
>   - **Increased stealth:** Attackers can tailor subsequent steps to avoid detection‚Äîtargeting 
>   overlooked or poorly monitored resources.
>   - **Data exposure:** Identification of exposed storage or secrets can result in 
>   immediate or subsequent sensitive data breaches.
> 
> #### Attack Flow and Methodology
> 
> 1. **Automated Enumeration:** Utilizing Azure CLI, PowerShell (e.g., `Get-AzResource`, `az resource list`), 
> REST APIs, or scripts, the attacker lists:
>   - Resource groups and their contents
>   - Virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, and Key Vaults
>   - Permissions and access policies associated with resources
> 2. **Asset Profiling:** The attacker collects details on configurations, public IPs, 
> RBAC permissions, and metadata for each resource.
> 3. **Vulnerability Identification:** Analysis focuses on resources where permissions, 
> network exposure, or configurations suggest potential for privilege escalation or data access.
> 4. **Preparation for Next Stages:** The attacker plans lateral movement, privilege 
> escalation, or direct attacks on data, using the knowledge obtained to target weak points.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > The attacker obtains credentials (via phishing, password spray, leaked keys) granting 
> at least Reader access to the target Azure tenant.

| Volt Typhoon              | [Microsoft] Volt Typhoon, a state-sponsored actor based in China that typically focuses on espionage and information gathering. Microsoft assesses with moderate confidence that this Volt Typhoon campaign is pursuing development of capabilities that could disrupt critical communications infrastructure between the United States and Asia region during future crises.[Secureworks] BRONZE SILHOUETTE likely operates on behalf the PRC. The targeting of U.S. government and defense organizations for intelligence gain aligns with PRC requirements, and the tradecraft observed in these engagements overlap with other state-sponsored Chinese threat groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | BRONZE SILHOUETTE, VANGUARD PANDA, UNC3236, Insidious Taurus, VOLTZITE, Dev-0391, Storm-0391 | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | Volt Typhoon has conducted pre-compromise reconnaissance for victim resource information.                                           | https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/aa24-038a_csa_prc_state_sponsored_actors_compromise_us_critical_infrastructure_3.pdf |
| HAFNIUM                   | HAFNIUM primarily targets entities in the United States across a number of industry sectors, including infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks, and NGOs. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) attributes this campaign with high confidence to HAFNIUM, a group assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China, based on observed victimology, tactics and procedures. HAFNIUM has previously compromised victims by exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers, and has used legitimate open-source frameworks, like Covenant, for command and control. Once they‚Äôve gained access to a victim network, HAFNIUM typically exfiltrates data to file sharing sites like MEGA.In campaigns unrelated to these vulnerabilities, Microsoft has observed HAFNIUM interacting with victim Office 365 tenants. While they are often unsuccessful in compromising customer accounts, this reconnaissance activity helps the adversary identify more details about their targets‚Äô environments. HAFNIUM operates primarily from leased virtual private servers (VPS) in the United States. | ATK233, G0125, Operation Exchange Marauder, Red Dev 13, Silk Typhoon, MURKY PANDA            | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | HAFNIUM has interacted with Office 365 tenants to gather details regarding target's environments.                                   | https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/                                                |
| FIN13                     | Since 2017, Mandiant has been tracking FIN13, an industrious and versatile financially motivated threat actor conducting long-term intrusions in Mexico with an activity timeframe stretching back as early as 2016. Although their operations continue through the present day, in many ways FIN13's intrusions are like a time capsule of traditional financial cybercrime from days past. Instead of today's prevalent smash-and-grab ransomware groups, FIN13 takes their time to gather information to perform fraudulent money transfers. Rather than relying heavily on attack frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, the majority of FIN13 intrusions involve heavy use of custom passive backdoors and tools to lurk in environments for the long haul.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | TG2003, Elephant Beetle                                                                      | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | FIN13 has searched for infrastructure that can provide remote access to an environment for targeting efforts.                       | https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/fin13-cybercriminal-mexico                                                                    |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üî≠ Reconnaissance`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Researching, identifying and selecting targets using active or passive reconnaissance.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`üíÖ Modify privileges`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify privileges or permissions
 - [`‚ú® Modify data`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify stored data or content

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üí∏ Monetary Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : The vector will directly conduct to loss of value directly impacting the bottom line.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`üí≤ Operating costs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Increased operating costs

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
