## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Custom Script Extensions in Azure are powerful automation tools for configuring 
> and managing Virtual Machines (VMs). However, attackers can exploit these extensions 
> to collect sensitive information in a variety of ways.
> 
> ## Credential Harvesting
> - **Stored Credentials:** Attackers deploy scripts that search for credentials stored 
> in plaintext files, configuration files, or environment variables.
> - **Credential Managers:** Scripts can target credential managers or vaults such 
> as Azure Key Vault, Windows Credential Manager, or third-party vaults to extract 
> stored credentials.
> 
> ## Configuration Files and Secrets
> - **Configuration Files:** Scripts can systematically search for and exfiltrate 
> configuration files containing sensitive data like database connection strings, 
> API keys, or other secrets.
> - **Environment Variables:** Attackers can extract environment variables that hold 
> sensitive configuration or authentication information.
> 
> ## Log Files and Audit Trails
> - **Log Files:** Scripts can access and exfiltrate log files that may contain sensitive 
> information, such as authentication logs, database logs, or application logs.
> - **Audit Trails:** Attackers can collect and exfiltrate audit trails that record 
> administrative actions or other sensitive activities.
> 
> ## Memory Scraping
> - **Running Processes:** Scripts can be designed to scrape memory from running processes 
> to extract sensitive information like session tokens, encryption keys, or other 
> in-memory data.
> - **DLL Injection:** Attackers can use DLL injection techniques within scripts to 
> extract sensitive data from running processes.
> 
> ## Network Traffic Interception
> - **Network Sniffing:** Scripts can enable network sniffing tools to capture sensitive 
> information transmitted over the network.
> - **Proxy Servers:** Attackers can configure proxy servers via scripts to intercept 
> and log network traffic, capturing sensitive data in transit.
> 
> ## Exploitation of Vulnerabilities
> - **Unpatched Software:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in unpatched software 
> to gain elevated privileges and execute scripts that collect sensitive information.
> - **Misconfigurations:** Misconfigurations in the VM or the environment can be exploited 
> to deploy and run malicious scripts.
> 
> ## Data Exfiltration Channels
> - **External Storage:** Scripts can exfiltrate collected data to external storage 
> solutions such as Azure Blob Storage, external servers, or other cloud storage services.
> - **Email Exfiltration:** Attackers can use scripts to send sensitive information 
> via email to an external address.
> - **Command and Control (C2) Servers:** Scripts can communicate with C2 servers 
> to exfiltrate data and receive further instructions.
> 
> ## Persistent Data Collection
> - **Scheduled Tasks:** Attackers can create scheduled tasks or services that periodically 
> execute scripts to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information over time.
> - **Backdoor Scripts:** Scripts can be designed to act as backdoors, allowing attackers 
> to execute commands and collect data as needed.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Attackers need to gain access to an Azure account with the Virtual Machine Contributor 
> role (or equivalent) can use custom script extensions to execute arbitrary code 
> as SYSTEM or root on VMs.

## Model Data

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`ü™£ Cloud Storage Accounts`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üóùÔ∏è Key Store`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üõ†Ô∏è Virtual Machines`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üîß Serverless`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üß© API Endpoints`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Portal`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üóÑÔ∏è Relational Database`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üóÑÔ∏è NoSQL Database`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üõ†Ô∏è Software Containers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Azure` : Placeholder
 - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Linux` : Placeholder
 - ` Azure AD` : Placeholder
 - ` Blob Storage` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üóø Repudiation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at performing prohibited operations in a system that lacks the ability to trace the operations.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üí∏ Monetary Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : The vector will directly conduct to loss of value directly impacting the bottom line.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
