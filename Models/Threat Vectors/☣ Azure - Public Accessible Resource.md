🔥 **Criticality:High** ⚠️ : A High priority incident is likely to result in a demonstrable impact to public health or safety, national security, economic security, foreign relations, civil liberties, or public confidence. 

🚦 **TLP:CLEAR** ⚪ : Recipients can spread this to the world, there is no limit on disclosure.

## 👁️ Description

> In Azure, this technique highlights the risk where certain resources—commonly **Network Interfaces** 
> and **Virtual Machines**—have public IP addresses or open ports, making them directly 
> reachable from the internet. Unlike other reconnaissance techniques, this isn’t 
> just about discovering resource metadata but about identifying resources configured 
> (intentionally or not) for public access.
> 
> #### How Attackers Use This Vector
> 
> - **Discovery Phase:** Attackers or researchers employ automated tools and scan 
> internet-facing IP space, hunting for live Azure VMs, network interfaces, and endpoints 
> whose public exposure can be confirmed.
> - **Enumeration Approaches:** 
>   - **Subdomain/Service Pattern Scanning:** Many Azure services use predictable 
>   domain structures (e.g., `*.azurewebsites.net`, `*.blob.core.windows.net`). 
>   Attackers enumerate these to find exposed resources.
>   - **Open Ports Scans:** Tools scan IPs for open RDP, SSH, web, or management ports.
> - **Public APIs and Metadata:** Some Azure resource information is available through 
> public APIs or unauthenticated metadata services, providing further opportunities 
> for adversaries to discover exposed resources.
> - **Real-World Tools:** Well-known tools include MicroBurst, AADInternals, and custom 
> scripts for mass scanning.
>   
> #### Specific Azure Resources at Risk
> 
> - **Network Interfaces:** Networking components that, if tied to public IPs, may 
> expose internal workloads.
> - **Virtual Machines:** Especially those configured with public IPs and ports like 
> RDP (3389) or SSH (22) open.
> - **App Services and Blob Storage:** Though not explicitly listed in AZT103, these 
> are also frequent targets for enumeration due to default public endpoints.
> - **Databases/Clusters:** Services like Azure Data Explorer or managed databases 
> may be misconfigured to allow public ingress.
> 
> #### Security Implications
> 
> - **Increased Attack Surface:** Exposing resources multiplies the number of direct 
> entry points for adversaries.
> - **Brute-Force and Vulnerability Exploitation:** Resources with public connectivity 
> are subject to constant automated attacks and vulnerability scans.
> - **Potential Lateral Movement:** Compromising one public resource can serve as 
> a foothold to move deeper into the Azure environment.

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`🔭 Reconnaissance`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Researching, identifying and selecting targets using active or passive reconnaissance.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `☁️ Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `☁️ Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`🛠️ Virtual Machines`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🌐 Network Equipment`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🖥️ Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🪣 Cloud Storage Accounts`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Azure` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`👻 Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user’s credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`🐒 Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`👁️‍🗨️ Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`⛔ Denial of Service`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action attempting to deny access to valid users, such as by making a web server temporarily unavailable or unusable.
 - [`💅 Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`🧠 IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`🌍 Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`💸 Monetary Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : The vector will directly conduct to loss of value directly impacting the bottom line.
 - [`🛑 Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
