## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> In some of the reports and analysis a Chinese-affiliated threat actor was
> observed abusing Google Calendar to deliver malware and establish Command
> and Control (CnC) communication.  
> 
> ### Abuse of Google calendar
> 
> A malware delivered payload has the capability to read and write events with
> an attacker-controlled Google calendar. Once executed, this malware creates
> a zero minute calendar event at a hardcoded date, with data collected from
> the compromised host being encrypted and written in the calendar event
> description.  
> 
> A threat operator places encrypted commands in calendar events on this date
> and next one day, which are predetermined dates also hardcoded into the
> malware. The malicious code then begins polling calendar for these events.
> When an event is retrieved, the event description is decrypted and the
> command it contains is executed on the compromised host. Results from the
> command execution are encrypted and written back to another calendar event
> ref [1]. 
> 
> In several steps below is represented the threat vector pattern how the
> threat actor manages to exploit a Google calendar ref [1]. 
> 
> - Initial access : The threat actor gains initial access to a victim's
> Google account, often through phishing or credential reuse.
> - Google calendar creation: As a next step the malicious actor creates
> a new Google Calendar event, which is used as a mechanism to deliver
> malware to the victim's device.
> - Malicious event creation: The threat actor creates a new event in the
> victim's Google calendar, which includes a malicious link or attachment.
> The event is often titled with a misleading or innocuous name to avoid
> suspicion.
> - Notification and delivery: When the event is created, Google calendar
> sends a notification to the victim's device, which includes the malicious
> link or attachment. If the victim interacts with the notification,
> the malware is delivered to their device.
> - CnC Communication: Once the malware is installed, the threat actor
> uses the compromised device to establish CnC communication. The malware
> communicates with the threat actor's command and control server, allowing
> them to issue commands, exfiltrate data, and further compromise the
> victim's network.  
> 
> Where
> 
> - C2 server - is the attacker controlled calendar. C2 commands are passed as
> encrypted google calendar events.
> - C2 communication - established from the agent to the attacker controlled
> google calendar over HTTPS to Google API, using valid credentials.
> - C2 agent - posts computer information into the attacker controlled google
> calendar. 
> 
> More detailed explanation is provided in ref [1].  
> 
> ### Used known tactics
> 
> - Event titles and descriptions: A Chinese-based threat actor group uses
> misleading event titles and descriptions to avoid suspicion and increase
> the likelihood of the victim interacting with the malicious event.
> - Malicious links and attachments: The threat actor uses malicious links or
> attachments in the event to deliver malware to the victim's
> device.
> - Calendar settings abuse: The threat actor configures the Google calendar
> settings to send notifications to the victim's device, ensuring that the
> malware is delivered even if the victim doesn't actively check their
> calendar.
> 
> By abusing Google calendar, the threat actor is able to deliver malware and
> establish CnC communication in a way that is difficult to detect and block.
> This tactic highlights the importance of monitoring cloud services and
> implementing robust security controls to prevent such attacks ref [1], [2].  
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > A threat actor is using social engineering initial technique to entice an
> end-user to open a malicious Google invitation (a mail or calendar
> invitation event) and get infected. 
> 
> The goal is an access and maintain of a persistence.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîê Persistence`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üë§ Customer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Customer
 - [`üñ≤Ô∏è Control Server`](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Control_Server) : A device which acts as both a server and controller, that hosts the control software used in communicating with lower-level control devices in an ICS network (e.g. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)).
 - [`üïπÔ∏è Remote access`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Remote access
 - [` Other`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Media - Other/Unknown
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`ü§¨ Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
