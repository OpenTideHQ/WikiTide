## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Password spraying is a technique that attackers use to try a small list
> of common or expected passwords against a set of usernames. This technique
> is used to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute
> forcing a single account with many passwords1. Password spraying is a
> sub-technique of credential spraying, which is just credential guessing
> but "sprayed" (i.e. against multiple accounts). (ref [1], [2])  
> 
> Adversaries have been observed using password spray attacks to exploit
> logins of network services or credential harvesting, typically used
> to obtain initial foothold.
> 
> They attempt username and password combinations in a slow manner,
> researching the pattern for valid accounts (e.g. email address or username
> length). Organizations targeted typically see a few authentication attempts
> per account; with nearly every attempt originating from constantly rotating
> IP addresses, many associated with the Tor anonymizing service.  
> 
> Some strategies conducted by adversaries are:  
> 
> - Credential stuffing towards Microsoft Office 365 accounts, there are
> tools that identify valid credentials for Office 365 and Azure AD accounts,
> as Spray365.  
> 
> - Abuse of Exchange servers. There are tools for searching through email
> in an Exchange environment for specific terms (passwords, insider intel,
> network architecture information, etc.) as for example MailSniper; which
> includes modules for password spraying, enumerating users and domains or
> gathering the Global Address List (GAL) from OWA and EWS.  
> 
> - Password spray against exposed Active Directory Federation Services
> (ADFS) infrastructure. The organizations not using MFA have a higher risk
> of having accounts compromised through password spray. If attack is
> successful, adversaries may look for additional contacts, sensitive
> information, privileged information, or send phishing links to
> others in the organization.  
> 
> 
> - Password spraying attack against Microsoft Entra ID applications
> Password spray attacks involve trying a few common passwords against
> specific or many accounts. This may include and attack against the
> cloud-based Microsoft application solution: Microsoft Entra ID. The
> goal is to bypass traditional protections like password lockout and
> malicious IP blocking. They can include low number of login attempts
> or lack of consistency which makes them difficult to detect.  
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversaries must look for different accounts to test a list of different
> frequently used weak passwords. To have success, the attacker need to 
> research what are the valid account patterns used for the Internet-facing
> applications used by the organisation such as VPN service or O365.

Despite broad scrutiny and reports on MuddyWater attacks, the activity continues with only incremental changes to the tools and techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | TEMP.Zagros, Static Kitten, Seedworm, MERCURY, COBALT ULSTER, G0069, ATK51, Boggy Serpens, Mango Sandstorm, TA450, Earth Vetala                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

| RASPITE                 | Dragos has identified a new activity group targeting access operations in the electric utility sector. We call this activity group RASPITE.  Analysis of RASPITE tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicate the group has been active in some form since early- to mid-2017. RASPITE targeting includes entities in the US, Middle East, Europe, and East Asia. Operations against electric utility organizations appear limited to the US at this time.  RASPITE leverages strategic website compromise to gain initial access to target networks. RASPITE uses the same methodology as DYMALLOY and ALLANITE in embedding a link to a resource to prompt an SMB connection, from which it harvests Windows credentials. The group then deploys install scripts for a malicious service to beacon back to RASPITE-controlled infrastructure, allowing the adversary to remotely access the victim machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | LeafMiner, Raspite                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîë Credential Access`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques resulting in the access of, or control over, system, service or domain credentials.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üë§ Former employee`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Former employee
 - [`üë§ Executive`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Executive

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Linux` : Placeholder
 - ` AWS` : Placeholder
 - ` Azure` : Placeholder
 - ` AD FS` : Placeholder
 - ` Active Directory` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üíÖ Modify privileges`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify privileges or permissions

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üò§ Nuisance`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Small and mostly inconsequential to day to day operations, but noticed.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Roughly even chance`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Roughly even odds - 45-55%
