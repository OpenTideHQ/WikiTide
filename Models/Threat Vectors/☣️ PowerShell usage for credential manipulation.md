## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Threat actors are using different methods to manipulate user's credentials.
> One example of credential manipulation is by using PowerShell commands or
> scripts. For example, PowerShell cmdlets or custom section of script can be
> used to gather credentials from Windows Credential Manager or other
> credentials stores in the system.
> 
> Example for access Windows Credential Manager credentials with PowerShell:
> 
> Install-Module CredentialManager -force
> New-StoredCredential -Target $url -Username $ENV:Username -Pass <parameter>
> Get-StoredCredential -Target <target>
> 
> Or threat actors can use ready PowerShell module for Credential Manager:
> 
> PS> Save-Module -Name CredentialManager -Path
> PS> Install-Module -Name CredentialManager -RequiredVersion <the_version>
> 
> Example for Get-Credential cmdlet. This is a PS command which prompts a
> user for his username and password, and then stores those credentials in a
> $Cred variable. The stored credentials are then passed to the Get-WmiObject
> cmdlet as the -Credential parameter, allowing the script to connect to the
> specified remote computer using those credentials.
> 
> Example: 
> 
> $Cred = Get-Credential
> Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem -ComputerName $Computer -Credential $Cred
> 
> With a Credential parameter threat actors can pass the $credential variable
> to other different commands.
> 
> Example:
> 
> PS> $credential.UserName
> root
> 
> GetNetworkCredential() method is used to obtain the user's passwords.
> A threat actor can append a "Password" property in the end of
> GetNetworkCredential() method to display the passwords in cleartext.
> 
> Example:
> 
> PS> $credential.GetNetworkCredential()
> 
> UserName Domain
> -------- ------
> root
> 
> PS51> $credential.GetNetworkCredential().Password
> <password_in_clear_text>
>

| UNC1878              | UNC1878 is a financially motivated threat actor that monetizes network access via the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Earlier this year, Mandiant published a blog on a fast-moving adversary deploying RYUK ransomware, UNC1878. Shortly after its release, there was a significant decrease in observed UNC1878 intrusions and RYUK activity overall almost completely vanishing over the summer. But beginning in early fall, Mandiant has seen a resurgence of RYUK along with TTP overlaps indicating that UNC1878 has returned from the grave and resumed their operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`‚ö° Execution`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üß© API Endpoints`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üñ≤Ô∏è Control Server`](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Control_Server) : A device which acts as both a server and controller, that hosts the control software used in communicating with lower-level control devices in an ICS network (e.g. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)).
 - [`üïπÔ∏è Remote access`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Remote access
 - [`üë§ System admin`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Administrator
 - [`üîë Server Authentication`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Authentication
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Web Application Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Active Directory` : Placeholder
 - ` PowerShell` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

 [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

 [`üò§ Nuisance`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Small and mostly inconsequential to day to day operations, but noticed.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
