## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> ### chained exploitation of CVE-2023-46805 or CVE-2024-21893 together with CVE-2024-21887.
> 
> Attackers may chain exploits on vulnerabilities CVE-2023-46805 and 
> CVE-2024-21893 on Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) appliances (that provide 
> remote VPN access to corporate infrastructures) to fully compromise the 
> vulnerale appliance.  
> 
> The code on the appliance checks whether access to the requested uri_path 
> requires authentication or not. For endpoint `/api/v1/totp/user-backup-code` 
> the check is done only on the start of the string.  
> 
> So an attacker can append additional characters that are passed to the 
> webserver without additional checks. Using path traversal technique, it is 
> then possible to access API endpoints that would require authentication 
> when accessed directly. For example, successful request to 
> `/api/v1/totp/user-backup-code/../../system/system-information` will return
> the system information.  
> 
> CVE-2023-46805 allows then to access any other uri_path without 
> authentication and enables exploitation of CVE-2024-21887.
> 
> Later it was reported that initial mitigations for CVE-2023-46805 could be 
> by passed by exploiting CVE-2024-21893 to bypass authentication and 
> enabling CVE-2024-21887 without using vulnerable uri paths or to drop 
> custom webshells ([BUSHWALK](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--96732cf0-d99a-501b-9646-c49f2b30dd5a) 
> [LIGHTWIRE](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--089bf6cc-9b67-5bd5-8fd3-3330e7cedf7e) 
> [CHAINLINE](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--4a3560fd-5ec5-5581-a8f7-1c888d28186b) 
> and others have been observed.  
> 
> Exploitation of the SSRF generates up to 2 log events:
> - AUT31556 on `/dana-ws/saml.ws`
> - ERR31093: Program saml-server recently failed. 
> 
> Likewise, exploition of CVE-2024-21893 or CVE-2024-22024 enables 
> exploitation of CVE-2024-21887.
> 
> ### Other TTPs
> 
> - *Configuration and data theft* Exfiltration of configuration or cache 
> data either in the response to the request (so on apparently legit activity)
> or by replacing or creating a new file under unauthenticated uri path.
> - CAV Web Server Log Exfiltration 
> - Internal Check tool tampering
> - System log clearing: In some instances, logs have been cleared using the legitimate system 
> utility therefore generating event ID ADM20599.

| Gelsemium | The Gelsemium group has been active since at least 2014 and was described in the past by a few security companies. Gelsemium‚Äôs name comes from one possible translation ESET found while reading a report from VenusTech who dubbed the group ÁãºÊØíËçâ for the first time. It‚Äôs the name of a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Gelsemiaceae, Gelsemium elegans is the species that contains toxic compounds like Gelsemine, Gelsenicine and Gelsevirine, which ESET choses as names for the three components of this malware family. | ÁãºÊØíËçâ       | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üí• Exploitation`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in systems that may, amongst others, result in code execution.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üîß Embedded` : Firmware, middleware and low level software running on devices which are typically not manageable by the consumer.
 - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `üåê Networking` : Communications backbone connecting users, applications and machines.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üïπÔ∏è Remote access`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Remote access
 - [`üõ°Ô∏è VPN Client`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Placeholder` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üö® Highly significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on central government, (inter)national essential services, a large proportion of the (inter)national population, or the (inter)national economy.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
