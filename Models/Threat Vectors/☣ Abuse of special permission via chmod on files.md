## 👁️ Description

> Attackers leverage the `chmod` utility to set the SUID (Set Owner User ID), 
> the SGID (Set Owner Group ID), or the Sticky bit on executables or scripts. 
> By abusing these bits, an adversary can temporarily inherit root- 
> or group-level privileges when the affected file is executed.  
> 
> This effectively grants them elevated rights that can be used to move laterally 
> within the environment, access or exfiltrate sensitive data, or escalate 
> privileges to maintain a stronger foothold on the system.  
> 
> Examples of SUID, SGID, and Sticky bit abuse:
> 
> SUID shell: Attackers can create a file with the setuid bit set and owned
> by the root user, and then use that file to gain root privileges and 
> execute a shell with root privileges.
> 
> SGID exploit: Attackers can find a file with the setgid bit set and owned
> by a group that has elevated privileges, and then use that file to gain the
> privileges of that group.
> 
> Sticky bit exploit: Attackers can set the sticky bit on a file to prevent
> it from being deleted or renamed, and then use that file to store malicious
> code or data.
> 
> In many Linux-based distributions (and similarly on macOS systems), 
> `chmod` is widely available and not restricted in typical configurations. 
> Attackers can take advantage of this by running commands such as:
> 
> ```bash
> chmod u+s /path/to/executable
> ```
> 
> or
> 
> ```bash
> chmod g+s /path/to/executable
> ```
> Depending on permissions misconfigurations, these commands may succeed if the 
> account in use has the necessary rights or if the system’s sudo settings 
> are overly permissive.  
> 
> Once the SUID or SGID bit is set on a critical binary, any user running that 
> binary subsequently executes it with elevated privileges. Threat actors have 
> been observed employing this technique to gain root-level access, tamper with 
> system logs, exfiltrate proprietary data, or introduce backdoors for persistence.  
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > An adversary must have local or SSH access to the target system, with credentials 
> allowing the use of chmod or sudo. Typically, this involves default or weak 
> configurations enabling chmod modifications on critical executables or scripts.

| TeamTNT              | In early Febuary, 2021 TeamTNT launched a new campaign against Docker and Kubernetes environments. Using a collection of container images that are hosted in Docker Hub, the attackers are targeting misconfigured docker daemons, Kubeflow dashboards, and Weave Scope, exploiting these environments in order to steal cloud credentials, open backdoors, mine cryptocurrency, and launch a worm that is looking for the next victim.They're linked to the First Crypto-Mining Worm to Steal AWS Credentials and Hildegard Cryptojacking malware.TeamTNT is a relatively recent addition to a growing number of threats targeting the cloud.

| UNC1878              | UNC1878 is a financially motivated threat actor that monetizes network access via the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Earlier this year, Mandiant published a blog on a fast-moving adversary deploying RYUK ransomware, UNC1878. Shortly after its release, there was a significant decrease in observed UNC1878 intrusions and RYUK activity overall almost completely vanishing over the summer. But beginning in early fall, Mandiant has seen a resurgence of RYUK along with TTP overlaps indicating that UNC1878 has returned from the grave and resumed their operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 🌌 MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`🥸 Privilege Escalation`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : The result of techniques that provide an attacker with higher permissions on a system or network.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `🏢 Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`🖥️ Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🖥️ Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`💻 Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Linux` : Placeholder
 - ` macOS` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`💅 Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`💅 Modify privileges`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify privileges or permissions
 - [`🦠 Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`🔄 Log tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Log tampering or modification
 - [`👁️‍🗨️ Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🌍 Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`💲 Operating costs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Increased operating costs

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
