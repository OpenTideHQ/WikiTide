## 👁️ Description

> ### overall description
> Cyber espionage threat actors continue to target technologies that do not 
> support endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions such as firewalls, 
> IoT devices, hypervisors, VPN technologies (e.g. Fortinet, SonicWall, 
> Pulse Secure, and others) or endpoint management solutions like 
> Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM).  
> 
> Those targets are often delivered as appliances (bundle of hardware and 
> software) and most of the time they do not have full-fleshed OS features 
> and come with limited command line interfaces.  
> 
> Best practice is to have out-of-band (OoB) management from a central 
> management console (dedicated network segment).  
> 
> Network seggregation, identity and access management for this OoB segment 
> has to be strictly configured and monitoring in place to detect any unusual
> source, account or actions performed.  
> 
> This can be a challenging objective as it depends on the level of verbosity
> of aufit logs (if any).  
> 
> If configuration is loose or management access is inadvertly allowed 
> from other interfaces, attackers may use valid accounts to access the 
> management plane of the device.  
> 
> Moreover those devices are most of the time by definition inline of 
> network flows coming from Internet. Attacker may obtain a Zero-day 
> vulnerability resulting in access to command line interface of the 
> device from the Internet-facing interfaces or privileged access 
> (adminitrator).
> 
> ### examples of specific attacks
> #### attack against Fortinet Fortigate firewall
> The attack against Fortigate is an illustration of the latter.  
> The following appliances have been in scope:
>   - FortiGate: FortiGate units are network firewall devices which allow 
>   for the control and monitoring of network traffic passing through the
>   devices.
>   - FortiManager: The FortiManager acts as a centralized management
>   platform for managing Fortinet devices.
>   - FortiAnalyzer: The FortiAnalyzer acts as a centralized log management 
>   solution for Fortinet devices as well as a reporting platform.
> 
> The following steps generally describe the actions the threat actor took:
>   - Utilized a directory traversal zero-day (CVE-2022-41328) exploit to 
>   write files to FortiGate firewall disks outside of the normal bounds 
>   allowed with shell access.
>   - Maintained persistent access with Super Administrator privileges within
>    FortiGate Firewalls through ICMP port knocking 
>   - Circumvented firewall rules active on FortiManager devices with a 
>   passive traffic redirection utility, enabling continued connections to 
>   persistent backdoors with Super Administrator privileges
>   - Established persistence on FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer devices 
>   through a custom API endpoint created within the device
>   - Disabled OpenSSL 1.1.0 digital signature verification of system files
>    through targeted corruption of boot files 
> 
> #### attack against Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) 
> "An authentication bypass vulnerability in Ivanti EPMM allows unauthorized 
> users to access restricted functionality or resources of the application 
> without proper authentication,"  
> 
> A "trusted source" informed Ivanti that CVE-2023-35078 was exploited in 
> attacks against a limited number of customers.  
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > The attackers need a way to reach to the appliance from Internet. 
> Either 
> - Direct network connectivity for example appliances manageable 
> behind a reverse proxy e.g. Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile.
> - Indirect network connectivity to the devices. 
> This is the case for network appliances like firewall, VPN, etc. 
> Those appliances are inline to process network traffic 
> therefore packets or requests might be crafted to access the 
> apliance itself.
> And then attackers need a way to get access on the managment plane 
> of the appliance. Quite often, this is enabled by
> - a Zero-day or unpatched vulnerability.
> - or compromised valid credentials and poor controls on the 
> management plane of the devices (no restriction on administrative 
> actions from Internet-facing interface)

| RedDelta                       | Likely Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group RedDelta targeting organizations within Europe and Southeast Asia using a customized variant of the PlugX backdoor. Since at least 2019, RedDelta has been consistently active within Southeast Asia, particularly in Myanmar and Vietnam, but has also routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical events. This is historically evident through the group’s targeting of the Vatican and other Catholic organizations in the lead-up to 2021 talks between Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Vatican officials, as well as throughout 2022 through the group’s shift towards increased targeting of European government and diplomatic entities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.During the 3-month period from September through November 2022, RedDelta has regularly used an infection chain employing malicious shortcut (LNK) files, which trigger a dynamic-link library (DLL) search-order-hijacking execution chain to load consistently updated PlugX versions. Throughout this period, the group repeatedly employed decoy documents specific to government and migration policy within Europe. Of note, we identified a European government department focused on trade communicating with RedDelta command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in early August 2022. This activity commenced on the same day that a RedDelta PlugX sample using this C2 infrastructure and featuring an EU trade-themed decoy document surfaced on public malware repositories. We also identified additional probable victim entities within Myanmar and Vietnam regularly communicating with RedDelta C2 infrastructure.RedDelta closely overlaps with public industry reporting under the aliases BRONZE PRESIDENT, Mustang Panda, TA416, Red Lich, and HoneyMyte. |                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 🌌 MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`🏃🏽 Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `🔧 Embedded` : Firmware, middleware and low level software running on devices which are typically not manageable by the consumer.
 - `🏢 Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `🌐 Networking` : Communications backbone connecting users, applications and machines.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`🔥 Firewall`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Network - Firewall
 - [`🛡️ IDS`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Network - IDS or IPs
 - [`🌐 Network Equipment`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🖥️ Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🌐 Router or switch`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Network - Router or switch

  - ` Linux` : Placeholder
 - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Network Router` : Placeholder
 - ` VMWare` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`💅 Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`👁️‍🗨️ Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`💀 Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`🔄 Log tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Log tampering or modification
 - [`⚙️ Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`💅 Modify privileges`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify privileges or permissions
 - [`🔐 New Accounts`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Ability to create new arbitrary user accounts.
 - [`📦 Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification
 - [`🐒 Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🛑 Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`🤬 Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.
 - [`💲 Operating costs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Increased operating costs

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
