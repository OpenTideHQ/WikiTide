## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> The GodFather malware is a highly advanced Android banking trojan that has evolved 
> into one of the most effective and disruptive mobile threats targeting financial, 
> banking, and cryptocurrency applications globally.
> 
> ### Main Threat Vectors
> 
> - **On-Device Virtualization**: GodFather‚Äôs core tactic is deploying a virtualization 
> framework on infected Android devices. It creates a virtual environment into which 
> it loads real banking or crypto apps. When a legitimate app is launched, the user 
> is redirected invisibly to the app‚Äôs clone running inside the sandbox, allowing 
> the malware to monitor every action, tap, and credential input in real-time.
> - **Overlay Attacks**: Beyond virtualization, GodFather can also display fake overlays 
> that look identical to lock screens or login pages, capturing PINs, patterns, or 
> passwords as users enter them, further compromising device and account security.
> - **Hooking and Network Interception**: The malware uses the Xposed framework to 
> hook into the OkHttp network library, which is utilized by many Android apps, thus 
> logging network requests and credentials.
> 
> ### Infection and Evasion
> 
> - **Infection Chain**: Typically distributed as trojanized or impersonated apps 
> (e.g., fake music downloaders or bogus ‚ÄúGoogle Protect‚Äù apps), GodFather prompts 
> users to grant invasive permissions for storage, SMS, contacts, and especially accessibility 
> services.
> - **Bypassing Security**: It employs advanced ZIP manipulation and code shifting 
> to the Java layer to bypass static analysis tools. It also hooks Android APIs such 
> as `getEnabledAccessibilityServiceList` to hide from anti-malware scans.
> - **Command Capabilities**: Once active, it supports a broad command set for attackers, 
> including remote control to simulate gestures, manipulate settings, execute overlay 
> attacks, log keystrokes, and exfiltrate a wide range of sensitive data.
> 
> ### Targets and Impact
> 
> - **Scope**: GodFather targets over 484 of the world‚Äôs most popular financial and 
> cryptocurrency apps, with campaigns observed in Europe, the U.S., Canada, Asia, 
> and the Middle East.
> - **Consequences**: It can lead to severe financial loss, reputational damage, operational 
> disruption, and regulatory fines for both consumers and organizations. The malware 
> is particularly dangerous in BYOD enterprise environments, as it can compromise 
> corporate data if personal devices are infected.
> - **Stealth**: The virtualization attack results in ‚Äúperfect deception,‚Äù as users 
> interact with their real apps, making visual or user-driven detection virtually 
> impossible.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversaries achieve granting AccessibilityService permissions to GodFather
> malware primarily through social engineering techniques that trick users into
> enabling these permissions.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üì¶ Delivery`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üì± Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üì± Mobile phone`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Mobile phone or smartphone
 - [`ü™™ Personal Information`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Android` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üí∏ Monetary Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : The vector will directly conduct to loss of value directly impacting the bottom line.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üò∞ Very Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Highly probable - 80-95%
