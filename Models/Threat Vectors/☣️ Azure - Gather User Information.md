## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> This technique describes how adversaries obtain information about user accounts 
> in Azure Active Directory (AAD), which can be leveraged for further attack planning 
> and targeting within a cloud environment.
> 
> ### Example Attack Scenario
> 
> An attacker with limited or no access to an Azure environment targets an organization 
> using Azure Active Directory. After they obtain information, attackers then cross-references 
> this information with social media profiles and other public data, building a list 
> of high-value users and their roles. Armed with these details, the attacker crafts 
> targeted phishing campaigns or searches for weak credentials and misconfigurations 
> with those accounts. For example, the attacker might use an Azure API such as `Get-AzureADUser` 
> to enumerate users if they have a valid credential, or scrape corporate websites 
> for employee contact details, inferring Azure AD presence.
> 
> ### Attack Goals and Impact
> 
> - **Primary Goal:** To obtain as much information about users as possible‚Äîespecially 
> privileged or high-value accounts‚Äîwithout alerting defenders.
> - **Impact:**
>   - Enables targeted social engineering, phishing attacks, and credential stuffing.
>   - Helps attackers identify privilege relationships, which aids in lateral movement 
>   planning and privilege escalation.
>   - Reveals organizational structure, making subsequent attacks more precise and effective.
>   - May lead to sensitive data exposure (including personal information if the account 
>   is later compromised).
> 
> ### Attack Flow and Methodology
> 
> 1. **Discovery & Enumeration:**
>   - Attacker passively searches public sources (corporate sites, LinkedIn) for names, 
>   roles, group memberships.
>   - If attacker obtains a valid account/credential (through phishing or prior compromise), 
>   they may use Azure AD enumeration APIs (`Get-AzureADUser`, etc.) to list all 
>   users, roles, and privileges.
> 
> 2. **Data Aggregation:**
>   - Combine enumerated internal data (user lists, group memberships) with external 
>   information (social media, breached databases).
>   - Map relationships and find which users have critical access, such as global 
>   administrators, application owners, or service principal managers.
> 
> 3. **Analysis & Targeting:**
>   - Identify users who are most likely susceptible to social engineering (frequently contacted staff, IT helpdesk).
>   - Prioritize accounts for further compromise attempts based on access level.
> 
> 4. **Preparation for Further Attack Phases:**
>   - Use gathered user information to launch credential stuffing, spear phishing, 
>   consent phishing, or authentication token theft attacks.
>   - Attempt further reconnaissance focused on those high-value targets, such as 
>   checking group assignment, roles, and recent activity.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversaries use publicly accessible endpoints, misconfigured applications, or phishing 
> emails to harvest user names, email addresses, job titles, and group memberships.

[Volt Typhoon](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1017) has emphasized stealth in operations using web shells, living-off-the-land (LOTL) binaries, hands on keyboard activities, and stolen credentials.(Citation: CISA AA24-038A PRC Critical Infrastructure February 2024)(Citation: Microsoft Volt Typhoon May 2023)(Citation: Joint Cybersecurity Advisory Volt Typhoon June 2023)(Citation: Secureworks BRONZE SILHOUETTE May 2023) | BRONZE SILHOUETTE, DEV-0391, Insidious Taurus, UNC3236, Vanguard Panda, Voltzite                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | üó°Ô∏è MITRE ATT&CK Groups     | Volt Typhoon has conducted extensive reconnaissance pre-compromise to gain information about the targeted organization.                                                 | https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/aa24-038a_csa_prc_state_sponsored_actors_compromise_us_critical_infrastructure_3.pdf     |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üî≠ Reconnaissance`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Researching, identifying and selecting targets using active or passive reconnaissance.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `üï∏Ô∏è SaaS` : Subscription based access to software.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üë§ Identity Services`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Azure` : Placeholder
 - ` Azure AD` : Placeholder
 - ` Office 365` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`üíÖ Modify privileges`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify privileges or permissions

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üí∏ Monetary Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : The vector will directly conduct to loss of value directly impacting the bottom line.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
