## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> This technique involves adversaries collecting data about applications running within Azure, 
> especially those registered in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The goal is to 
> gain insight into application properties, configurations, exposed endpoints, permission 
> scopes, and connections, in order to identify potential attack paths or vulnerabilities.
> 
> ### Example Attack Scenario
> 
> An adversary, during an initial reconnaissance campaign, uses publicly accessible 
> APIs and Azure Active Directory (AAD) enumeration techniques to gather information 
> about applications registered within the target's Azure tenant. By leveraging permissions 
> such as `microsoft.directory/applications/*/read`, the attacker can identify applications, 
> service principals, their permissions, owners, secrets, and roles. For instance, 
> an attacker using a compromised regular user account attempts to list all AAD applications 
> and their configurations. They extract details on app registration, API permissions, 
> and whether any apps have high privilege assignments, such as access to sensitive 
> data or elevated directory permissions. This information is used to map potential 
> targets for privilege escalation or lateral movement.
> 
> ### Attack Goals and Impact
> 
> - **Goals:**
>   - Identify high-value applications and their associated service principals.
>   - Determine application permissions and trust relationships within AAD.
>   - Uncover misconfigurations, excessive privileges, or applications with weak security 
>   controls.
>   - Establish a list of applications for further exploitation, such as app impersonation, 
>   secret harvesting, or abuse of delegated permissions.
> 
> - **Impact:**
>   - Facilitates subsequent privilege escalation or lateral attacks if vulnerable 
>   apps/service principals are identified.
>   - May allow attackers to target apps for unauthorized access to sensitive information 
>   or execution of high-impact operations.
>   - Lays the groundwork for consent phishing attacks or abuse of poorly secured 
>   app registrations.
>   - Increases the risk of data exposure, unauthorized resource manipulation, and 
>   tenant-wide compromises if attackers pivot successfully.
> 
> ### Attack Flow and Methodology
> 
> 1. **Data Gathering:**
>   - Executes read operations using permissions like `microsoft.directory/applications/*/read` 
>   to pull application names, identifiers, associated owners, API permissions, and 
>   role assignments.
>   - Enumerates app secrets/certificates and checks for possible excessive API scopes, 
>   such as Application.ReadWrite.All or RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory.
> 
> 2. **Analysis of Privilege Assignments:**
>   - Evaluates permissions and assignments to locate applications with elevated 
>   rights or direct access to critical resources.
>   - Identifies owners who may be targeted for account compromise or further social 
>   engineering.
> 
> 3. **Planning Further Attacks:**
>   - Maps application interrelationships and privilege chains to design next-phase 
>   attacks, such as credential theft, application takeover, or phishing consent requests.
>   - Assesses whether any applications are misconfigured, exposing endpoints or 
>   secrets unintentionally.
> 
> 4. **Use of Discovered Data:**
>   - Uses harvested application data to target privilege escalation (e.g., adding 
>   new credentials to an app as seen in advanced API permission abuse scenarios).
>   - May initiate attacks such as impersonation using app secrets or deploying malicious 
>   applications with elevated permissions.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversaries obtain minimal access (often as a standard user or via an external account) 
> in the target Azure AD tenant, then utilizes API endpoints and tools, such as Azure CLI, 
> PowerShell modules (e.g., MSOnline, Microsoft.Graph), or custom scripts, to list 
> all registered applications.

The highly personalized nature of spear-phishing attacks makes it more  difficult to identity than widescale phishing attacks. | [T1566.001 : Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001 'Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems Spearphishing attachment is a spe')                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üî≠ Reconnaissance`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Researching, identifying and selecting targets using active or passive reconnaissance.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`ü™£ Cloud Storage Accounts`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üë§ Identity Services`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üß© API Endpoints`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Portal`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Azure` : Placeholder
 - ` Azure AD` : Placeholder
 - ` Office 365` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
