## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Phishing with Azure AD B2B Collaboration involves exploiting the service to send 
> malicious invitations that appear to come from Microsoft or other third-parties,
> making it difficult for the user to detect that it is not legitimate.
> Here are the key points:
> 
> ### Malicious Invitations 
> Adversaries can create a free trial for Azure AD Premium and set up an Enterprise App 
> with single sign-on (SSO) through a user-defined URL, which can be the adversary 
> own website. This app can then be assigned to new users, allowing the adversaries to 
> insert phishing recipients[1].
> 
> ### Email Elements
> The invitation email typically includes a warning about phishing, but the email 
> itself appears legitimate. It is sent from a Microsoft address and includes a link 
> to a landing page that may redirect users to the adversary site. The email may 
> also include the inviter name and profile image for added credibility[3].
> 
> ### Authentication Flow 
> When a user accepts the invitation, they are redirected to the adversary site, 
> may look like a legitimate Microsoft page. This can be achieved by creating an 
> outdated OneDrive logo or using a well-known brand name in the Entra ID organization[1].
> 
> ### Technical Details 
> The phishing campaign can be set up using PowerShell commands to manage Azure AD 
> and MSOnline modules. The adversaries can also use the Create invitation API to 
> customize the invitation message and ensure it appears legitimate[2][4].
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversaries need administrative privileges or access to an existing Azure AD Premium account, or to create a new free trial account. After this, the capability to set up an Enterprise App with single sign-on through a user-defined URL, which can be their own website to deceive the user.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`ü™ù Social Engineering`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques aimed at the manipulation of people to perform unsafe actions.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `üï∏Ô∏è SaaS` : Subscription based access to software.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`ü™™ Personal Information`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`ü™£ Cloud Storage Accounts`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üë§ Identity Services`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Portal`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üîë Server Authentication`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Authentication
 - [`üïπÔ∏è Remote access`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Remote access

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Office 365` : Placeholder
 - ` Azure AD` : Placeholder
 - ` Azure` : Placeholder
 - ` PowerShell` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üîê New Accounts`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Ability to create new arbitrary user accounts.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üìâ Competitive disadvantage`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Loss of competitive advantage
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`ü§¨ Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
