## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> A threat actor can successfully maintain persistence on a compromised system 
> by using scheduled tasks to create or edit registry entries.
> 
> Windows Scheduled Task is a feature of the Windows operating system that 
> allows users to schedule a command or program to run automatically at a 
> specific time or interval. This can be useful for running tasks that need to
> be performed regularly, such as backing up files or checking for updates. 
> Scheduled tasks can be configured to run in the background, without the need
> for user intervention.
> 
> One example for a scheduled task that establish persistence in the registry 
> is a task that is configured to run when specific condition is met - as 
> example on system start up. The task will have an action configured, which 
> might be to download and run a payload, which for example could be a payload
> that sets a registry run key. Registry run keys are keys in the Windows 
> registry that are called during system start up. These keys enable 
> configurations to be loaded automatically. Registry run keys can also 
> directly execute binary files on system start up. 
> 
> To create a scheduled task that runs at system startup attackers are using 
> for example Windows Task Scheduler, cmd.exe or PowerShell commands in a 
> script. Once the task has been created, it will be added to the registry and 
> will run automatically every time the system starts up, or until discovered 
> and deleted.
> 
> **Examples for mechanism of persistence in the registries**
> 
>  - Run/RunOnce Keys: Malware can add entries to the registry keys
>  (or their RunOnce counterparts) to execute every time the system
>  boots or a user logs in. An example for such Reg keys:
>  
>  ` HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run `
>  
>  or 
>  
>  ` HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run `
>  
>  
>  - Scheduled Tasks: Utilizing the Task Scheduler, malware can create
>  tasks that run at specific intervals or times, ensuring persistence.
>  These tasks are often registered in the registry under
>  
>  ` HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache `.
> 
>  - Windows Services: Malicious services can be installed and configured
>  to start automatically upon system boot. These are typically registered
>  under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`.
> 
> ### Additional persistence techniques
> 
> Other common techniques used by malware in general include:
> 
> - **Modifying Registry Keys**: Malware often alters specific registry keys 
> (like those in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`) 
> to ensure they are executed at startup.
> 
> - **Modifying Registry Keys**: The following enables the malware to run for all 
> users on the system: (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run)
> 
> - **Using Startup Folders**: Malware can place executable files in startup
> folders so that they run automatically when a user logs into their account.   
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > An adversary has gained control over a Windows endpoint and has privileges 
> to create scheduled tasks in order to maintain persistence in the registry.

Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) attributes this campaign with high confidence to HAFNIUM, a group assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China, based on observed victimology, tactics and procedures. HAFNIUM has previously compromised victims by exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers, and has used legitimate open-source frameworks, like Covenant, for command and control. Once they‚Äôve gained access to a victim network, HAFNIUM typically exfiltrates data to file sharing sites like MEGA.In campaigns unrelated to these vulnerabilities, Microsoft has observed HAFNIUM interacting with victim Office 365 tenants. While they are often unsuccessful in compromising customer accounts, this reconnaissance activity helps the adversary identify more details about their targets‚Äô environments.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîê Persistence`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Windows` : Placeholder

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`‚ú® Modify data`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify stored data or content

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
