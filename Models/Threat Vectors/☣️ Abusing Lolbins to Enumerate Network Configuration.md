## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> System Network Configuration Discovery refers to an adversary‚Äôs effort to gather
> and enumerate network-related information from compromised systems. This activity 
> is often a precursor to more aggressive tactics, including lateral movement 
> or data exfiltration. By executing commands or employing specific utilities to 
> determine active network interfaces, routing tables, firewall states, and open ports, 
> threat actors can map out an organization‚Äôs network architecture. 
> This information allows them to identify potential choke points, pivot opportunities, 
> and security gaps that could be exploited in subsequent stages of an attack.
> 
> ## Common Tools & Commands
> ### Windows  
> 
> 1) cmd.exe:
>   - `ipconfig` to display IP addresses and network interfaces. 
>   - `netstat` to list active TCP/UDP connections and listening ports.
>   - `route print` to display routing tables.  
> 
> 2) powershell.exe: 
>   - `Get-NetIPConfiguration` to display IP addresses and network interfaces. 
>   - `Get-NetTCPConnection` to display active network connections.
>   - `Get-NetRoute` to display routing tables.  
> 
> 3) netsh.exe: 
>   - `netsh interface ip show config` for advanced interface information. 
>   - `netsh interface ip show dns` to display DNS settings.
> 
> 4) nslookup.exe: 
>   - `nslookup <domain_name>` to display DNS records for a domain name. 
> 
> 5) wmic.exe: 
>   - `wmic nic get` to display network interface settings.
>   - `wmic route get` to display routing tables.
> 
> ### Linux and macOS 
>   - `ifconfig` or `ip` to show IP address configuration and network interfaces.  
>   - `arp` to examine the ARP table for link-layer address mapping.  
>   - `netstat` or `ss` to display active connections and listening services.  
>   - `route` to view or modify the IP routing table.  
>   - `iptables`, `firewall-cmd`, `ufw` to query or adjust firewall settings.  
>   - `dig` to query DNS servers and display DNS records.

| TeamTNT              | In early Febuary, 2021 TeamTNT launched a new campaign against Docker and Kubernetes environments. Using a collection of container images that are hosted in Docker Hub, the attackers are targeting misconfigured docker daemons, Kubeflow dashboards, and Weave Scope, exploiting these environments in order to steal cloud credentials, open backdoors, mine cryptocurrency, and launch a worm that is looking for the next victim.They're linked to the First Crypto-Mining Worm to Steal AWS Credentials and Hildegard Cryptojacking malware.TeamTNT is a relatively recent addition to a growing number of threats targeting the cloud. While they employ some of the same tactics as similar groups, TeamTNT stands out with their social media presence and penchant for self-promotion. Tweets from the TeamTNT‚Äôs account are in both English and German although it is unknown if they are located in Germany.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Adept Libra                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

| APT28                | The Sofacy Group (also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear and Sednit) is a cyber espionage group believed to have ties to the Russian government.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üß≠ Discovery`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that allow an attacker to gain knowledge about a system and its network environment.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üåê Network Equipment`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` macOS` : Placeholder
 - ` Linux` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üî• Substantial incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a medium-sized organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a large organisation or wider / local government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`ü¶† Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
