## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> User Account Control (UAC) is a security feature implemented in the Windows 
> operating system to prevent potentially harmful programs from making changes 
> to user's computer. The threat actors explore and apply different techniques
> and ways to bypass this Winsows security mechanism ref [1].      
> 
> For example, some of the used techniques to bypass UAC are:
> 
> ### DLL Hijacking
> 
> This technique involves placing a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file
> in a directory that is part of the system's search path. When the targeted
> application loads the required DLL, it inadvertently loads the malicious
> DLL instead, granting the attacker elevated privileges.  
> 
> Some initially prepared payloads, for example a usage of rundll32.exe can
> load a specifically crafted DLL may auto-elevate COM objects and perform
> a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require
> elevated access.  
> 
> ### COM Elevation
> 
> Component Object Model (COM) is a Microsoft technology used for
> communication between software components. By exploiting a vulnerability
> in the way the system handles COM objects, an attacker can elevate their
> privileges and bypass UAC.  
> 
> ### Windows Registry modification
> 
> A threat actor can change the behavior or the UAC prompt or even completely
> turn it off. Their goal is privilege escalation ref [2, 3].    
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System]
>     "ConsentPromptBehaviorUser"=dword:00000000 ; Automatically deny elevation requests
>     "EnableInstallerDetection"=dword:00000000
> ````
> 
> ### Fileless Attacks
> 
> Fileless attacks, such as PowerShell or Windows Management Instrumentation
> (WMI) exploits, can be used to execute malicious code in memory, without
> writing any files to the disk. This allows the attacker to bypass UAC,
> as it doesn't monitor in-memory activities.
> 
> ### Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities
> 
> Some applications may have vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain
> elevated privileges. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, an attacker
> can bypass UAC and execute code with higher privileges.
> 
> For example, the Github readme page for UACMe contains an extensive list of 
> methods that have been discovered and implemented within UACMe or the process
> eventvwr.exe can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script
> ref [7].    
> 
> ### Malicious software installation (skip the UAC prompt)
> 
> Another technique to bypass the UAC could be achieved by malicious software
> injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting
> a user.

| APT29               | A 2015 report by F-Secure describe APT29 as: 'The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. The Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States;Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments;organizations associated with Chechen extremism;and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large - scale spear - phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash - and - grab approach involving a fast but noisy breakin followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible.If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long - term intelligence gathering. This threat actor targets government ministries and agencies in the West, Central Asia, East Africa, and the Middle East; Chechen extremist groups; Russian organized crime; and think tanks. It is suspected to be behind the 2015 compromise of unclassified networks at the White House, Department of State, Pentagon, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The threat actor includes all of the Dukes tool sets, including MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, SeaDuke, CloudDuke (aka MiniDionis), and HammerDuke (aka Hammertoss).

| Lazarus Group       | Since 2009, HIDDEN COBRA actors have leveraged their capabilities to target and compromise a range of victims; some intrusions have resulted in the exfiltration of data while others have been disruptive in nature. Commercial reporting has referred to this activity as Lazarus Group and Guardians of Peace. Tools and capabilities used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include DDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and wiper malware. Variants of malware and tools used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include Destover, Duuzer, and Hangman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Operation DarkSeoul, Dark Seoul, Hidden Cobra, Hastati Group, Andariel, Unit 121, Bureau 121, NewRomanic Cyber Army Team, Bluenoroff, Subgroup: Bluenoroff, Group 77, Labyrinth Chollima, Operation Troy, Operation GhostSecret, Operation AppleJeus, APT38, APT 38, Stardust Chollima, Whois Hacking Team, Zinc, Appleworm, Nickel Academy, APT-C-26, NICKEL GLADSTONE, COVELLITE, ATK3, G0032, ATK117, G0082, Citrine Sleet, DEV-0139, DEV-1222, Diamond Sleet, ZINC, Sapphire Sleet, COPERNICIUM, TA404, Lazarus group, BeagleBoyz, Moonstone Sleet | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting                                                                  | No documented references                                                                     |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üèÉüèΩ Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üë§ Customer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Customer
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üîë Server Authentication`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Authentication
 - [`üë§ System admin`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Administrator
 - [` Other`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Media - Other/Unknown
 - [`üß© Windows API`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/windows-api-list) : The Windows API, informally WinAPI, is Microsoft's core set of application programming interfaces (APIs) available in the Microsoft Windows operating systems. The name Windows API collectively refers to several different platform implementations that are often referred to by their own names (for example, Win32 API). Almost all Windows programs interact with the Windows API.

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Windows` : Placeholder

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üî• Substantial incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a medium-sized organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a large organisation or wider / local government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`ü¶† Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üì¶ Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü§¨ Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`üò§ Nuisance`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Small and mostly inconsequential to day to day operations, but noticed.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
