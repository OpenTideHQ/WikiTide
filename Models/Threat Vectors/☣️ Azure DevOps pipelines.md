## 👁️ Description

> Azure DevOps pipelines are a critical component in modern software development but 
> also present significant attack surfaces for threat actors. Key threats include 
> supply chain compromises, insider attacks, privilege escalation vulnerabilities, 
> and misconfigurations that can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious 
> code execution.
> 
> ## Comprehensive Threat Vectors for Azure DevOps Pipelines
> 
> ### Supply Chain Attacks
> - **Malicious Extensions and Tasks:** Attackers may upload harmful extensions to 
> the Azure DevOps Marketplace, which can execute arbitrary code if installed and 
> run in pipelines.
> - **Compromised Build Agents:** Outdated or unpatched build agents can be exploited 
> to gain persistent access or execute malicious code within pipelines.
> - **Dependency Poisoning:** Malicious code can be injected into package dependencies 
> (e.g., NuGet, npm, Maven), which are then pulled and executed during pipeline builds.
> - **Third-Party Tool Integrations:** Compromised integrations or plugins can introduce 
> vulnerabilities into the pipeline execution environment.
> 
> ### Insider Threats
> - **Unauthorized Pipeline Modifications:** Users with access can alter pipeline 
> YAML files or scripts to introduce malicious code, especially if branch protections 
> are weak or absent.
> - **Token Abuse:** Attackers can abuse pipeline job tokens (e.g., swapping short-term 
> for persistent tokens via vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-29813) to escalate privileges 
> or access sensitive resources.
> - **Malicious Code Injection:** Insiders might inject malicious scripts or commands 
> during pipeline runs, potentially bypassing code reviews if pull requests are not 
> enforced.
> 
> ### Credential and Secret Exposure
> - **Hardcoded Secrets:** Storing API keys, passwords, or tokens directly in pipeline 
> scripts or configuration files can lead to exposure if logs are not properly secured.
> - **Leaked Logs:** Pipeline logs may inadvertently contain sensitive information 
> if proper masking and filtering are not enforced.
> - **Forked Repositories:** Secrets in pipelines can be exposed if pipelines run 
> on forked repositories, especially if pull requests are not properly secured.
> - **Insufficient Secret Rotation:** Failing to regularly rotate secrets increases 
> the risk of exploitation if credentials are compromised.
> 
> ### Network and Access Control Weaknesses
> - **Unrestricted Network Access:** Lack of IP allowlisting or network security groups 
> (NSGs) can allow attackers to access pipeline resources from untrusted locations.
> - **Weak Authentication:** Using personal access tokens (PATs) instead of OAuth 
> or managed identities can increase the risk of credential theft.
> - **Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Overprivileged users or service 
> accounts can lead to unauthorized actions or data exfiltration.
> - **Lack of Isolation:** Pipelines not isolated from each other or from sensitive 
> resources can enable lateral movement within the environment.
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > Adversaries may gain access by stealing user credentials, including personal access 
> tokens (PATs) or Azure Active Directory (AAD) tokens, often through phishing or 
> credential theft.

The highly personalized nature of spear-phishing attacks makes it more  difficult to identity than widescale phishing attacks. | [T1566.001 : Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001 'Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems Spearphishing attachment is a spe')                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`⚡ Execution`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `☁️ Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `🕸️ SaaS` : Subscription based access to software.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`👻 Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user’s credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`🐒 Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`🗿 Repudiation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at performing prohibited operations in a system that lacks the ability to trace the operations.
 - [`💀 Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`👁️‍🗨️ Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`💅 Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`🔐 New Accounts`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Ability to create new arbitrary user accounts.
 - [`⚙️ Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`💅 Modify privileges`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify privileges or permissions
 - [`✨ Modify data`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify stored data or content
 - [`📦 Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`🧠 IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`🌍 Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`🥸 Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`💸 Monetary Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : The vector will directly conduct to loss of value directly impacting the bottom line.
 - [`🤬 Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.
 - [`🛑 Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`💲 Operating costs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Increased operating costs
 - [`📉 Competitive disadvantage`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Loss of competitive advantage

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
