## 👁️ Description

> A previously unseen backdoor named Grager was deployed against three
> organizations in the past - Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Vietnam in April
> 2024. Trojan.Grager is a second APT malware implant leveraging the
> Microsoft Graph API from a multi-step malware campaign abusing
> cloud services ref [1, 2].  
> 
> The analysis of the backdoor revealed that it used the Graph
> API to communicate with a C&C server hosted on Microsoft OneDrive.
> Grager was downloaded from a typosquatted URL mimicking an open-
> source file archiver 7-Zip (7 zip .msi file) ref [1].  
> 
> The .msi dropper, is a Trojanized 7-Zip installer that installs
> the real 7-Zip software into the Windows Program Files folder
> (C:\Program Files (x86)\7-Zip) along with a malicious DLL named
> `epdevmgr.dll`, a copy of the Tonerjam malware, and the encrypted
> Grager backdoor into a file named `data.dat` ref [1].   
> 
> The backdoor leverages a custom application layer protocol for
> communication with its command and control server, allowing it to bypass
> traditional network security tools and evade detection. Grager employs
> various stealth techniques, such as obfuscation and anti-analysis methods,
> to evade antivirus software and remain undetected.  
>

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`💥 Exploitation`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in systems that may, amongst others, result in code execution.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains [DEPRECATED]**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `🏢 Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `☁️ Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `☁️ Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **🎯 Targets [DEPRECATED]**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`🖥️ Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`👤 Customer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Customer
 - [`🖥️ Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation
 - [`🖲️ Control Server`](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Control_Server) : A device which acts as both a server and controller, that hosts the control software used in communicating with lower-level control devices in an ICS network (e.g. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)).
 - [`🎞️ Media`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Media player or recorder

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned [DEPRECATED]**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Windows` : Placeholder

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`🧨 Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`🦠 Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`💀 Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`💅 Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`👁️‍🗨️ Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`📦 Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🛑 Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`🩼 Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`🌍 Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
