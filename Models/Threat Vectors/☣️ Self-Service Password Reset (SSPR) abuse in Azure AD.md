## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Self-service password reset (SSPR) is an Azure AD feature that allows users to
> reset their password without the involvement of an administrator or help desk. 
> It is designed for convenience and productivity so that users who forgot their
> password or get locked out can easily reset it themselves with minimal friction.
> 
> Administrators are able to configure SSPR for the entire organization or a subset 
> of groups via the Azure portal. They can also define requirements for permitted 
> forms of verification and the number of verification methods required to perform 
> the reset.
> 
> ## methods
> 
> There are two primary methods through which adversaries have been abusing this tool:
> 
> - SIM swapping to gain initial access
> - Attacker registered MFA to establish persistence
> 
> SIM swapping is an increasingly popular tactic that adversaries use to take 
> control of a target phone number. This typically involves social engineering a
> mobile carrier in order to initiate a number transfer to a new SIM card or
> bribing internal employees to execute a swap. 
> 
> If an adversary controls the card and the organization SSPR is configured to
> only require a single verification method, attackers should have no problem 
> establishing initial access and enroll their own MFA methods for persistence,
> typically mobile authenticator applications or disposable emails.
> 
> 
> ## reconnaisance
> 
> Successful SIM swapping needs sufficient preliminary SSPR reconnaissance to
> identify a viable target. Aside from requiring the information to social engineer
> a mobile carrier, the adversary needs to determine whether or not the target is
> even susceptible to SSPR abuse.
> 
> Given any email address, it is easy to validate if it is a valid Microsoft 365 
> account. The below curl command can be used to determine if a given email address
> is a managed account in Microsoft 365:
> 
> curl -s -X POST https:///login.microsoftonline.com/common/GetCrede... ‚Äìdata ‚Äò{‚ÄúUsername‚Äù:‚Äùuser@domain.com‚Äù}‚Äô
> 
> Once valid Microsoft 365 accounts are identified, attackers initiate the SSPR flow
> to see which verification options are available. Attackers likely need to perform
> this recon as well if they are going to spend the time and effort performing the
> initial SIM swap.
> 
> The Microsoft interface that appears during a SSPR clearly indicates whether one 
> or two verification methods are required, making it easier for attackers to select
> vulnerable target accounts. 
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > The administrator of the targeted Azure tenant must have SSPR enabled.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîë Credential Access`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques resulting in the access of, or control over, system, service or domain credentials.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `üì± Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üîê Auth token`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Authentication token or device
 - [`‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Portal`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üë§ Identity Services`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üì± Mobile phone`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Mobile phone or smartphone

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` EU Login` : Placeholder
 - ` Android` : Placeholder
 - ` iOS` : Placeholder
 - ` Azure AD` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`ü§î Unlikely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Improbable (improbably) - 20-45%
