## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Adversaries seeking to gain or maintain elevated privileges often target the 
> ownership and permissions of critical files or directories. By changing a 
> file‚Äôs owner to a privileged account (e.g., SYSTEM on Windows, `root` on Linux, 
> or `root:wheel` on macOS), threat actors ensure that their malicious tools, 
> binaries, or configuration files inherit elevated trust levels. 
> This manipulation can facilitate various malicious objectives, including 
> executing code with higher privileges, bypassing security controls, 
> and evading detection.  
> 
> ### Windows
> 
> Attackers may use built-in utilities such as `takeown.exe` or `icacls.exe` 
> to change ownership and grant Full Control permissions to a high-privilege 
> user or group.  
> 
> For instance:  
> ```powershell
> takeown.exe /f C:\sensitive_data.txt
> icacls.exe C:\sensitive_data.txt /setowner Administrator
> icacls.exe C:\sensitive_data.txt /grant Administrator:F
> ```
> 
> By doing so, they can ensure that subsequent manipulations of these files, 
> including the addition of backdoors, data exfiltration tools, 
> or credential-stealing binaries, are executed under a privileged context.  
> 
> ### Linux and macOS
> 
> Threat actors mainly rely on the `chown` command to modify file ownership. 
> But other commands may achieve the same objective like chgrp or setfacl 
> 
> For example:
> ```bash
> sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/malicious_script
> ```
> 
> Once a file is owned by `root`, it can be paired with setuid bits 
> or extended attributes, enabling the file to run with elevated privileges. 
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > The adversary must have sufficient privileges (e.g., local administrator 
> or root permissions) on the target host or domain controller to modify 
> file ownership attributes.

| UNC1878             | UNC1878 is a financially motivated threat actor that monetizes network access via the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Earlier this year, Mandiant published a blog on a fast-moving adversary deploying RYUK ransomware, UNC1878. Shortly after its release, there was a significant decrease in observed UNC1878 intrusions and RYUK activity overall almost completely vanishing over the summer. But beginning in early fall, Mandiant has seen a resurgence of RYUK along with TTP overlaps indicating that UNC1878 has returned from the grave and resumed their operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                    | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |
