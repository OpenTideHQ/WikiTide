## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Threat actors may use Windows commad prompt commands to search for, access
> in order to manipulate (create, modify, delete, read) user's credentials
> locally or in a domain. For example, they can extract user's passwords from
> Credential Manager. Windows Credential Manager is a store with all user's
> saved passwords automatically during user daily work. It provides an
> interface from where the credentials can be managed. To access Credential
> Manager, the threat actor needs to elevate his previleges to administrator
> and run the command promt console with "Run as administrator".
> 
> Cmdkey.exe is a command-prompt utility which can create, list, and delete
> stored user names and passwords or credentials. It's usually located in the 
> %SYSTEM% sub-folder and its usual size is around 13,850 bytes.
> 
> Example for try to gain user's details with cmdkey from Windows Credential
> Manager:
> 
> cmdkey /list:testTarget
> 
> The command returns the Target(testTarget), Type(Domain Password), and the
> Username(testUser).
> 
> A threat actor can also manipulate the Credential Manager database, for
> example to add, modify or delete credentials from manager sections. It is
> possible to add an Internet or network address, user name, password and
> others.
> 
> Example for adding of entry in Credential Manager. With the command below
> a threat actor can add username-password key pair for access to specific
> system.
> 
> cmdkey /add:computer-name /user:user-name /pass:your-password
> 
> Example for deletion of entry in Credential Manager. A threat actor fist
> execute list command to see all potential targets and select an entry for
> deletion.
> 
> cmdkey /list
> cmdkey /delete:target-name
> 
> Another approach to search and retrieve user's credentials with command
> promt is for example with net utility. Net utility executed via the network 
> is used to query for user's password. The passwords can be storred on shared
> network drives or locally.
> 
> Example:
> 
> net use \\unc\path /user:username password
> 
> or 
> 
> net use \\%userdnsdomain% /user:%userdomain%\%username% *
> 
> The asterisk at the end forces to ask for password.
> 
> With net utility a threat actor can also modify already existing user name
> or password or to delete the existing credentials entry. 
> 
> Examples: 
> 
> net user <username> *
> <type a new password>
> <retype the new password to confirm>
> 
> The command below will set the password to blank:
> net user username "" 
> 
> The following command will remove the password for the user with the
> specified userneme:
> 
> net user <username> /passwordreq:no
>

| APT39                   | APT39 was created to bring together previous activities and methods used by this actor, and its activities largely align with a group publicly referred to as "Chafer." However, there are differences in what has been publicly reported due to the variances in how organizations track activity. APT39 primarily leverages the SEAWEED and CACHEMONEY backdoors along with a specific variant of the POWBAT backdoor. While APT39's targeting scope is global, its activities are concentrated in the Middle East. APT39 has prioritized the telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel industry and IT firms that support it and the high-tech industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Chafer, REMIX KITTEN, COBALT HICKMAN, G0087, Radio Serpens, TA454, ITG07, Burgundy Sandstorm                                                                                           | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

The group works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.(Citation: FireEye APT34 Dec 2017)(Citation: Palo Alto OilRig April 2017)(Citation: ClearSky OilRig Jan 2017)(Citation: Palo Alto OilRig May 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto OilRig Oct 2016)(Citation: Unit42 OilRig Playbook 2023)(Citation: Unit 42 QUADAGENT July 2018)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | APT34, COBALT GYPSY, Crambus, EUROPIUM, Earth Simnavaz, Evasive Serpens, Hazel Sandstorm, Helix Kitten, IRN2, ITG13, TA452                                                             | üó°Ô∏è MITRE ATT&CK Groups     | No documented sighting | No documented references |
| OilRig                  | OilRig is an Iranian threat group operating primarily in the Middle East by targeting organizations in this region that are in a variety of different industries; however, this group has occasionally targeted organizations outside of the Middle East as well. It also appears OilRig carries out supply chain attacks, where the threat group leverages the trust relationship between organizations to attack their primary targets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Twisted Kitten, Cobalt Gypsy, Crambus, Helix Kitten, APT 34, APT34, IRN2, ATK40, G0049, Evasive Serpens, Hazel Sandstorm, EUROPIUM, TA452, Earth Simnavaz                              | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

|                         | OilRig is an active and organized threat group, which is evident based on their systematic targeting of specific organizations that appear to be carefully chosen for strategic purposes. Attacks attributed to this group primarily rely on social engineering to exploit the human rather than software vulnerabilities; however, on occasion this group has used recently patched vulnerabilities in the delivery phase of their attacks. The lack of software vulnerability exploitation does not necessarily suggest a lack of sophistication, as OilRig has shown maturity in other aspects of their operations.

|                         | OilRig relies on stolen account credentials for lateral movement. After OilRig gains access to a system, they use credential dumping tools, such as Mimikatz, to steal credentials to accounts logged into the compromised system. The group uses these credentials to access and to move laterally to other systems on the network. After obtaining credentials from a system, operators in this group prefer to use tools other than their backdoors to access the compromised systems, such as remote desktop and putty. OilRig also uses phishing sites to harvest credentials to individuals at targeted organizations to gain access to internet accessible resources, such as Outlook Web Access.Since at least 2014, an Iranian threat group tracked by FireEye as APT34 has conducted reconnaissance aligned with the strategic interests of Iran. The group conducts operations primarily in the Middle East, targeting financial, government, energy, chemical, telecommunications and other industries. Repeated targeting of Middle Eastern financial, energy and government organizations leads FireEye to assess that those sectors are a primary concern of APT34. The use of infrastructure tied to Iranian operations, timing and alignment with the national interests of Iran also lead FireEye to assess that APT34 acts on behalf of the Iranian government.                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                        |                            |                        |                          |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`‚ö° Execution`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üß© API Endpoints`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ≤Ô∏è Control Server`](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Control_Server) : A device which acts as both a server and controller, that hosts the control software used in communicating with lower-level control devices in an ICS network (e.g. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)).
 - [`üïπÔ∏è Remote access`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Remote access
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Web Application Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Windows` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üî´ Localised incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on an individual, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a small or medium-sized organisation.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

 [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

 [`üò§ Nuisance`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Small and mostly inconsequential to day to day operations, but noticed.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
