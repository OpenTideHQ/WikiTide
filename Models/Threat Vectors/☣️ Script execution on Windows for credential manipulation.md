## 👁️ Description

> One example of script execution for credential manipulation is the use of a
> Python or other type of script to access and read/change a user's credentials
> stored in a file, such as Windows Credential Manager. 
> The script could be designed to read the file, decrypt the stored
> credentials, make changes to the username or password, and then save the
> updated information back to the file. Threat actors are using also different
> cmd utilities in combination with script commands to gain or modify user's
> credentials. For example, such utilities can be cmdkey, keyring libraries
> and others.
> 
> Example for a script that can manipulate a credentials file:
> 
> import os
> import json
> import base64
> 
> # Function to encrypt the credentials
> def encrypt_credentials(credentials):
> encoded_credentials = base64.b64encode(json.dumps(credentials).encode())
> return encoded_credentials.decode()
> 
> # Function to decrypt the credentials
> def decrypt_credentials(encoded_credentials):
> decoded_credentials = json.loads(base64.b64decode(encoded_credentials).decode())
> return decoded_credentials
> 
> # Function to update the credentials
> def update_credentials(username, password):
> # Reading the credentials from file
> with open("credentials.txt", "r") as file:
>     encoded_credentials = file.read()
> # Decrypting the credentials
> credentials = decrypt_credentials(encoded_credentials)
> # Updating the username and password
> credentials["username"] = username
> credentials["password"] = password
> # Encrypting the updated credentials
> encoded_credentials = encrypt_credentials(credentials)
> # Saving the updated credentials to file
> with open("credentials.txt", "w") as file:
>     file.write(encoded_credentials)
> 
> # Function call to update the credentials
> update_credentials("new_username", "new_password")
> 
> Example for python code which extracts user's credentials with cmdkey utility:
> 
> import os
> 
> os.system('cmdkey /add:TERMSRV/X.X.X.X/user:Administrator /pass:<password>')
> os.system('mstsc /v:X.X.X.X')
> os.system('cmdkey /delete:TERMSRV/X.X.X.X')
> 
> Example for keyring library python script for credential manipulation.
> Keyring libraries are used to manage the credentials. In the script threat 
> actors are using different functions like: set_credentials(),
> get_credentials() and update_credentials() to set, retrieve or change
> username and password for the specific user or service. Keyring library
> uses the operating system's secure storage to store the credentials. 
> This secure storage provides credential encryption and the passwords are
> not stored in plain text.
> 
> import keyring
> 
> # Function to set the credentials
> def set_credentials(username, password):
> keyring.set_password("service_name", username, password)
> 
> # Function to get the credentials
> def get_credentials():
> username = input("Enter your username: ")
> password = keyring.get_password("service_name", username)
> return username, password
> 
> Some credential stealers, for example Ryuk and TrickBot are based on custom
> scripts. For example, TrickBot is configured to use network propagation
> script modules (sharedll and tabdll) that rely on SMB and can harvest
> credentials and propagate to additional systems in the network.

| UNC1878              | UNC1878 is a financially motivated threat actor that monetizes network access via the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Earlier this year, Mandiant published a blog on a fast-moving adversary deploying RYUK ransomware, UNC1878. Shortly after its release, there was a significant decrease in observed UNC1878 intrusions and RYUK activity overall almost completely vanishing over the summer.

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`⚡ Execution`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `🏢 Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `☁️ Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `☁️ Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`🧩 API Endpoints`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🖥️ Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation
 - [`💻 Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`👤 End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`🖲️ Control Server`](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Control_Server) : A device which acts as both a server and controller, that hosts the control software used in communicating with lower-level control devices in an ICS network (e.g. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)).
 - [`🕹️ Remote access`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Remote access
 - [`👤 System admin`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Administrator
 - [`🔑 Server Authentication`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Authentication
 - [`🖥️ Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🖥️ Web Application Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Active Directory` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`🧨 Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

 [`🐒 Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

 [`😤 Nuisance`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Small and mostly inconsequential to day to day operations, but noticed.

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
