## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Direct modification of registry keys to tamper with scheduled tasks
> involves altering the Windows Registry to manipulate or disable scheduled
> tasks. 
> 
> Scheduled tasks are stored in the Windows Registry, and modifying these
> registry keys can allow an attacker to:
> 
> - Disable or modify existing tasks: by changing the registry keys
> associated with a scheduled task, an attacker can prevent the task from
> running or alter its behavior.
> - Create new malicious tasks: An attacker can add new registry keys
> to create a malicious scheduled task that runs without the user's
> knowledge.
> - Elevate privileges: modifying registry keys can allow an attacker
> to escalate privileges, enabling them to execute tasks with higher
> privileges.
> 
> The registry keys which involved in scheduled tasks could be:
> 
> ```
> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache
> 
> ```
> This key contains subkeys for each scheduled task, including:
> 
> - Tasks: Stores information about each task, such as the task name,
> description, and execution settings.
> - Boot: Stores information about tasks that run at boot time.
> - Logon: Stores information about tasks that run at logon time.
> 
> ### Modifying registry keys to tamper with scheduled tasks
> 
> To modify registry keys and tamper with scheduled tasks, an attacker
> would typically follow these steps:
> 
>   - Access the Registry Editor: The attacker would need to access the
>   Windows Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) with administrative privileges.
>   - Navigate to the scheduled task registry key. 
>   The attacker would navigate to the registry key:
>   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache key`.
>   - Identify the target task: The attacker would identify the subkey
>   associated with the scheduled task they want to modify or disable.
>   - Modify the registry key: The attacker would modify the registry
>   key to change the task's behavior, such as changing the execution
>   settings or disabling the task.  
> 
> ### Examples of registry key modifications
> 
> Some examples of registry key modifications that can tamper
> with scheduled tasks include:
> 
> - Disabling a task: Setting the Enabled value to 0 in the task's subkey.
> - Changing the task's execution settings: Modifying the Actions or Triggers
> values in the task's subkey.
> - Creating a new malicious task: Adding a new subkey with malicious
> settings, such as executing a malicious executable.

| HAFNIUM              | HAFNIUM primarily targets entities in the United States across a number of industry sectors, including infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks, and NGOs. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) attributes this campaign with high confidence to HAFNIUM, a group assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China, based on observed victimology, tactics and procedures. HAFNIUM has previously compromised victims by exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers, and has used legitimate open-source frameworks, like Covenant, for command and control. Once they‚Äôve gained access to a victim network, HAFNIUM typically exfiltrates data to file sharing sites like MEGA.In campaigns unrelated to these vulnerabilities, Microsoft has observed HAFNIUM interacting with victim Office 365 tenants. While they are often unsuccessful in compromising customer accounts, this reconnaissance activity helps the adversary identify more details about their targets‚Äô environments.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîê Persistence`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [` Other`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Media - Other/Unknown

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Windows` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`ü§¨ Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.
 - [`üí≤ Operating costs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Increased operating costs

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
