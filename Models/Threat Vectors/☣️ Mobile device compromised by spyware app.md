## 👁️ Description

> Earlier versions of spyware apps were installed on smartphones through vulnerabilities
> in commonly used apps, or involving an SMS or iMessage that provides a link to a website. 
> If clicked, this link delivers malicious software that compromises the device.
> It can also be installed over a wireless transceiver located near a target,
> or manually if attacker can steal the phone that has been targeted.  
> 
> Since 2019, attackers have been able to install spyware on smartphones with a missed call on WhatsApp,
> including delete the record of the missed call, making it impossible for the owner to know anything is amiss.
> Another way is by simply sending a message to a phone that produces no notification.  
> 
> In the latest versions of spyware does not require the user to do anything. All that is required for a
> successful spyware attack and installation is having a particular vulnerable app or OS installed on the device,
> such as vulnerabilities in the iMessage service in iPhones which allows for infection by simply receiving a message.
> This is known as a zero-click exploit.     
> 
> Once installed, spyware malware can theoretically harvest any data from the device and transmit
> it back to the attacker. It can steal photos and videos, recordings, location records, communications,
> web searches, passwords, call logs and social media posts.
> It also has the capability to activate cameras and microphones for real-time surveillance
> without the permission or knowledge of the user.  
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > Adversaries can abuse iOS or Android devices which are vulnerable
> to a zero-click or zero-day exploitation, without user intervention.

| MuddyWater              | The MuddyWater attacks are primarily against Middle Eastern nations. However, we have also observed attacks against surrounding nations and beyond, including targets in India and the USA. MuddyWater attacks are characterized by the use of a slowly evolving PowerShell-based first stage backdoor we call “POWERSTATS”. Despite broad scrutiny and reports on MuddyWater attacks, the activity continues with only incremental changes to the tools and techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | TEMP.Zagros, Static Kitten, Seedworm, MERCURY, COBALT ULSTER, G0069, ATK51, Boggy Serpens, Mango Sandstorm, TA450, Earth Vetala | 🌌 MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`📦 Delivery`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `📱 Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`👤 End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`👤 Executive`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Executive
 - [`👤 Manager`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Manager
 - [`📱 Mobile phone`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Mobile phone or smartphone
 - [`🪪 Personal Information`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`📱 Tablet`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Tablet

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Android` : Placeholder
 - ` iOS` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`👽 Alter behavior`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Influence or alter human behavior
 - [`👁️‍🗨️ Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`⚙️ Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`✨ Modify data`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify stored data or content
 - [`📦 Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification
 - [`🐒 Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`🥸 Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`🌍 Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
