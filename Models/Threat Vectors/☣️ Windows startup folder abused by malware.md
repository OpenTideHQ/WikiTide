## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> The Windows Startup folder is a legitimate feature in Windows that allows
> users to specify programs or applications to launch automatically when the
> operating system starts. In several reports and analysis different threat
> actors have been known to abuse this feature to achieve persistence and
> evade detection on compromised systems. 
> 
> As a first step the malware is distributed by an initial threat vector, for
> example spear-phishing attack. Once the malware is on the targeted system it
> creates a shortcut or executable file in the Windows Startup folder
> ref [5], [6].
> 
> There are several different possible startup locations which can be used
> by the threat actors to run malicious programs. 
> 
> Examples:
> 
> - `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
> - `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`.
> - `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
> - `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
> 
> A recent campaign, ref [2], showed threat actors exploiting a vulnerability
> in a software application  to deploy shortcut files in the startup folder,
> that would point to the malicious executable.
> 
> When the user logs in or the system boots, Windows automatically executes
> the programs or applications in the Startup folder. Usually the malware is
> disguised as a legitimate program and runs in the background, often without 
> the user's knowledge or consent.
> 
> ### Techniques used by malware
> 
> - Shortcut files: Malware creates a shortcut file (.lnk) in the Startup
>   folder, pointing to the malicious executable.
> - Executable files: Malware places an executable file (.exe) directly in the
>   Startup folder.
> - Registry modifications: Some malware (Amadey) may also overwrite the 
> Windows registry key, thush changing the startup folder to the ones 
> containing its payload.
> - Scripts - some threat actors have used the startup folder as a persistence 
> mechanism to execute script files.
> - Archive exploitation: WinRAR or crafted installers extract payloads into
>   the Startup folder (notably CVE-2023-38831 exploited in the wild).
> 
> ### Known malware families which can abuse a Windows Startup folder
> 
> - Ransomware: Some ransomware variants, like WannaCry and NotPetya, used
>   the Startup folder to launch their malicious payloads.
> - Trojans: Trojans, such as Emotet and TrickBot, have been known to use the
>   Startup folder to maintain persistence on compromised systems.
> - Adware/PUP: Adware or Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs), like the 
> notorious Ask Toolbar, has been found to use the Startup folder to launch 
> themselves.  
> - LNK Loaders (e.g Gamaredon) ref [7].

| Gamaredon Group              | Unit 42 threat researchers have recently observed a threat group distributing new, custom developed malware. We have labelled this threat group the Gamaredon Group and our research shows that the Gamaredon Group has been active since at least 2013.  In the past, the Gamaredon Group has relied heavily on off-the-shelf tools. Our new research shows the Gamaredon Group have made a shift to custom-developed malware. We believe this shift indicates the Gamaredon Group have improved their technical capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ACTINIUM, DEV-0157, Blue Otso, BlueAlpha, G0047, IRON TILDEN, PRIMITIVE BEAR, Shuckworm, Trident Ursa, UAC-0010, Winterflounder, Aqua Blizzard, Actinium | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | No documented references                                                                                                    |

That is because spear-phishing attackers attempt to obtain vast amounts of personal information about their victims.   Attackers can get the personal information they need using different ways:   - to compromise an email or messaging system trough other means, - to use OSINT, sourcing Social Media or glean personal information from the user's online presence. They want to craft emails that look as legitimate and attractive as possible  to increase the chances of fooling their targets, for instance sending a malicious  attachment where the filename references a topic the recipient is interested in.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîê Persistence`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üìÇ Directory`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Directory (LDAP, AD)
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üë§ Customer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Customer
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [` Other`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Media - Other/Unknown

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Windows` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`ü§¨ Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
