## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> A malicious .lnk file can be crafted to execute arbitrary code, download
> malware, or exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system. The threat
> actors can use social engineering tactics to trick users into downloading
> and opening these files, which can lead to some of the following threats
> ref [1], [2]:
> 
> - Malware infection: The .lnk file can download and install malware,
> such as viruses, Trojans, or ransomware, onto the workstation.
> - Code execution: The file can execute malicious code, potentially
> allowing attackers to gain control of the workstation or steal sensitive
> data.
> - Exploitation of vulnerabilities: Malicious .lnk files can exploit known
> vulnerabilities in the operating system or applications, leading to further
> compromise.
> 
> In one of the observed and reported threat actor cyber-espionage campaigns
> a North Korean threat actor spreads spear-phishing e-mails containing a link
> to a password-protected document which contains LNK file.  
> 
> The lure contains a e-mail with a title "Political Advisory Meeting to
> be held at the EU Delegation on May 14." This was both the e-mail subject
> and the name of a zip file sent through a Dropbox link. The mail contains
> a password-protected zip file with included .lnk file in it. Once an end-
> usr click this file, it will download a payload usually from a GitHub 
> repository. Further the payload executes and infect the host.   
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Threat actor rely on social engineering techniques for initial access.

| [Enterprise] Kimsuky | [Kimsuky](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094) is a North Korea-based cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2012. The group initially focused on targeting South Korean government entities, think tanks, and individuals identified as experts in various fields, and expanded its operations to include the UN and the government, education, business services, and manufacturing sectors in the United States, Japan, Russia, and Europe. [Kimsuky](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094) has focused its intelligence collection activities on foreign policy and national security issues related to the Korean peninsula, nuclear policy, and sanctions.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üèÉüèΩ Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üë§ Customer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Customer
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Office 365` : Placeholder
 - [` Github`](https://docs.github.com/en) : GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`ü§¨ Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.
 - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
