## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> The following threat vector enables adversaries to misuse Azure Storage's replication 
> features for data exfiltration or to facilitate other attacks with significant business impact.
> 
> ## Example Attack Scenario
> 
> An attacker compromises access to a victim's Azure Storage account, obtaining enough 
> permissions to configure **object replication**. The attacker then creates their 
> own storage account in a different Azure tenant or region and establishes a replication 
> policy from the victim's storage. As a result, sensitive or operational data is 
> asynchronously and automatically copied from the victim‚Äôs container to the attacker's 
> environment‚Äîpotentially outside tenant or even cross-cloud provider lines‚Äîwithout 
> further interaction. The attacker can now access the replicated content at will, 
> maintaining persistence and visibility even if their original access to the victim 
> account is revoked.
> 
> ## Attack Goals and Impact
> 
> - **Exfiltration**: The primary goal is the **covert exfiltration of data**‚Äîpotentially 
> at massive scale and with minimum detection, because the process leverages legitimate 
> replication mechanisms.
> - **Persistence and Stealth**: By using cross-region or cross-tenant replication, 
> an attacker ensures ongoing access to copied data even after being discovered and 
> evicted from the original environment.
> - **Evasion and Regulatory Breach**: Since Azure Storage object replication can 
> occur across geographical boundaries, this attack can make detection harder and 
> may also result in regulatory compliance violations (e.g., unauthorized cross-border 
> data transfers).
> - **Potential for Secondary Impact**: With replicated data, attackers may enable 
> ransomware (encrypting or destroying primary data, but retaining a copy elsewhere), 
> enable further attacks by gleaning credentials or configuration details from exfiltrated 
> files, or deliver **malware** to victim environments using inbound replication.
> 
> ## Attack Flow and Methodology
> 
> 1. The adversary enumerates storage resources, searches for containers of interest, 
> and assesses the feasibility of replication configuration.
> 2. Using their access, the attacker creates an **object replication policy** from 
> victim storage to a destination account they control, potentially in a different 
> geographic region or Azure tenant.
>     - Outbound replication exfiltrates data; inbound can inject payloads.
>     - Cross-tenant replication may currently require explicit configuration, and 
>     new Azure defaults restrict this, but legacy or misconfigured accounts remain vulnerable.
> 3. Replication occurs asynchronously, repeatedly syncing new or changed objects. 
> The attacker harvests data from their own account, separate from the victim‚Äôs monitoring 
> and controls, thus bypassing many detection points.
> 4. Depending on their goal, the attacker may leave replication running for long-term 
> persistence or attempt to erase traces from the victim environment.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversaries obtains credentials or elevated permissions (via access keys, Service 
> Principal abuse, RBAC misconfigurations, or privilege escalation) to the victim‚Äôs 
> storage account.

| Storm-0501 | Storm-0501 is a financially motivated cybercriminal group that has been active since 2021, initially targeting US school districts with the Sabbath ransomware and later transitioning to a RaaS model deploying various ransomware strains, including Embargo. The group exploits weak credentials and over-privileged accounts to achieve lateral movement from on-premises environments to cloud infrastructures, establishing persistent backdoor access and deploying ransomware. They have utilized techniques such as credential theft, exploiting vulnerabilities in Zoho ManageEngine and Citrix NetScaler, and employing tools like Cobalt Strike and Rclone for lateral movement and data exfiltration. Storm-0501 has specifically targeted sectors such as government, manufacturing, transportation, and law enforcement in the United States. |           | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | The actor undertook a series of operations that led to data exfiltration and deletion. This included a comprehensive discovery phase to locate the organisation‚Äôs critical assets, including data stores that contained sensitive information. | https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ransomware-deletes-data-backups/ |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üí• Impact`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques aimed at manipulating, interrupting or destroying the target system or data.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`ü™£ Cloud Storage Accounts`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üß© API Endpoints`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Portal`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Azure` : Placeholder
 - ` Azure AD` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üß† IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
