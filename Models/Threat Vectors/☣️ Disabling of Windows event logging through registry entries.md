## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Threat actors can disable Windows event logs by adding, deleting or modifying
> registry entries manually or with commands in a command-line prompt. 
> 
> The threat actor may disable the Windows Event log events manually via
> Event Viewer properties or with CLI commands to disable a specific event or
> all of them. Threat actors may also use script files or PowerShell to change
> the registry.
> 
> If the threat actors want to disable event logging manually via registry
> entries, they have to find the associated GUID to the event that will delete. The
> GUID can be taken for example from Event Viewer > Select specific event log
> > Event Properties > in Details select "XML view". (example for GUID id:
> Giud="{BD12F3B8-4DE1-TR31-DE39RET84L12}") After this the threat actor
> navigates to the registry with the GUID that needs to delete and change
> the value of the dword in the registry key "Enabled" to 0.
> 
> Example: 
> 
> 1. Example for disabling the logging of all event logs via registry entry:
> 
> reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog" /v Start /t REG_DWORD /d 4 /f
> 
> 2. Example for disabling the logging of a specific event log via registry entry:
> 
> reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog[Log Name]" /v TypesSupported /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
> 
> 3. Manual change in the registry of the registry key "Enable" (dword value) to 0. 
>   
>   Registry: 
>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger\EventLog-System
> 
>   Dword value change in the registry key "Enable":
> 
>   "Enabled"=dword:0
>   "EnableProperty"=dword:0
> 
> Example for change of Audit policies in the registries:
> 
> psexec -s -i regedit (the command needs system-level access to run)
> After that in HKLM\SECURITY\Policy\PolAdtEv registry hive in the registry
> editor "Edit Binary Value", 16-bit (two-byte) values can be changed to
> 00 00 which means no audit. For example replace the data started with 
> 01 00 01 00 to 00 00 00 00
> 
> - 00 00 means no auditing
> - 01 00 means success auditing
> - 02 00 means failure auditing
> - 03 00 means all auditing
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > A threat actor has gained control over a Windows endpoint and has

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

The I/O server, sometimes referred to as a Front-End Processor (FEP) or Data Acquisition Server (DAS), converts the control system application data into packets that are transmitted over various types of communications media to the end device locations. The I/O server also converts data received from the various end devices over different communications mediums into data formatted to communicate with the control system networked applications.

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

 [`üîÑ Log tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Log tampering or modification

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

 [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
