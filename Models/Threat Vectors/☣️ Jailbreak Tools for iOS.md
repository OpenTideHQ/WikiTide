## 👁️ Description

> Jailbreaking an iPhone involves bypassing Apple's security restrictions to gain 
> root access to the device, allowing users to install unauthorized apps, tweaks, 
> and customizations. While this can provide enhanced functionality, it also introduces 
> significant security risks. Below is an analysis of the threat vector associated 
> with jailbreaking tools based on the provided sources.
> 
> ### Jailbreaking Tools
> 
> Jailbreaking tools exploit vulnerabilities in iOS to remove Apple's restrictions. 
> These tools vary depending on the iOS version and device type. For example:
> - **Taurine** works for iOS 14.0–14.8.1.
> - **Dopamine 2.x** supports iOS 15.0–16.6.1 on certain devices.
> - **PaleRa1n** is used for older devices (A11 and below) running iOS 15–17.
> 
> These tools often leverage kernel vulnerabilities to enable capabilities such as 
> tweak injection, theming, and sideloading apps.
> 
> ### Types of jailbreaks:
> 
> 1. Tethered jailbreak: Requires the device to be connected to a computer to boot into
>     a jailbroken state.
> 
> 2. Semi-tethered jailbreak: Allows the device to boot into a jailbroken state without
>    being connected to a computer, but may require a computer to re-jailbreak the device
>    after a reboot.
> 
> 3. Untethered jailbreak: Allows the device to boot into a jailbroken state without being
>    connected to a computer, and the jailbreak is preserved even after a reboot.
> 
> ### Security Risks of Jailbreaking
> 
> 1. **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities**:
>   - Jailbreaking tools exploit known vulnerabilities in iOS, which inherently weakens 
>   the device's security posture. Once jailbroken, the device becomes more susceptible 
>   to malware and unauthorized access.
> 
> 2. **Loss of System Integrity**:
>   - Jailbreaking modifies the core system files, potentially leading to instability, 
>   crashes, or bricking of the device.
> 
> 3. **Exposure to Malicious Software**:
>   - Many jailbreak tweaks and apps are distributed outside of Apple's App Store, 
>   increasing the risk of installing malicious software.
> 
> 4. **Bypassing Security Features**:
>   - Features like Secure Enclave and sandboxing are compromised in a jailbroken 
>   environment, exposing sensitive data such as passwords and encryption keys.
> 
> 5. **No Official Support**:
>   - Apple does not support jailbroken devices, leaving users without official updates 
>   or security patches.
> 
> ### Current Status of Jailbreak Tools
> - For newer iOS versions (iOS 17 and 18), no full jailbreak tools are publicly available 
> yet. However, semi-jailbreak solutions like MisakaX and Nugget exist for limited customization.
> - Older versions (iOS 15 to 16) have stable jailbreaks like Dopamine and PaleRa1n with 
> tweak support.
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > If adversaries have physical access to the device, they can install a jailbreaking tool
> that include the neccesary exploit. If no physical access is available, it is possible
> to exploit a zero-day vuln to bypass the device' security mechanisms.
>

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`🏃🏽 Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `📱 Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`📱 Mobile phone`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Mobile phone or smartphone
 - [`🪪 Personal Information`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`📱 Tablet`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Tablet

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`👻 Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user’s credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`🐒 Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`👁️‍🗨️ Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`📦 Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`🥸 Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`🩼 Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`🧠 IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`🤬 Lose Capabilities`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Vector execution will remove key functions to the organization, which will not be easily circumvented. Most day-to-day is heavily impaired, but processes can reorganize at a loss.

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
