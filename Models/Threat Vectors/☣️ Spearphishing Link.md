## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an
> attempt to gain access to victim systems. This sub-technique employs
> the use of links to download malware, instead of attaching malicious
> files to the email itself to avoid defences that may inspect email
> attachments.      
> 
> All forms of spearphishing are targeted at a specific individual or
> company. Generally, the links will be accompanied by social engineering
> text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste an URL into
> a browser, leveraging user execution. The visited website may compromise
> the web browser using an exploit, or the user will be prompted to download
> applications, documents, zip files, or even executables depending on the
> pretext for the email in the first place. Attackers may also include links
> that are intended to interact directly with an email reader, including
> embedded images intended to exploit the end system directly or verify
> the receipt of an email (i.e. web bugs/web beacons).  
> 
> In this type of phishing a threat actor impersonates to appear as
> a user's trusted contact like their colleague or other known friends.
> Threat actors can also impersonate a large companies with trustworthy
> image, brand and reputation to give the emails more believability and
> reach. They put deceptive links in the email to entice a victim to
> click on the link ref [4, 5].        
> 
> In some of the spearphishing campaigns, a threat actor named Webworm
> was using GitHub malicious repositories and links to them to spread and
> infect more developers and end-users. As GitHub is one of the top million
> domains with a lot of visits and clicks the attacker's goal is to hide
> in plain sight.   
> 
> #### AI-themed phishing campaigns
> 
> Adversaries create spearphishing links or sites that mimic AI
> applications, which appear to offer legitimate AI tools, tricking
> users into downloading and executing trojanised AI-themed software.
> For example, this could lead to the installation of Gipy malware,
> a strain of infostealer malware that steals sensitive information
> and loads additional malicious software from GitHub, including
> various types of information stealers and remote access trojans.  
> 
> #### Themed-documents lure campaigns 
> 
> Several reports mention that the threat actors prepare their campaign 
> by using areas of activity and visual identity of companies or public 
> administrations in contact with the targets in order to craft more 
> deceiving and appealing emails to lure the targets. This preparation
> aims to raise the successful rate of the phishing campaigns.  
> 
> Spearphishing emails prepared to deal with topics in the areas of an 
> Union entity may decive more Union entity staff to follow the link.
> ref [b].  
> 
> In one campaign it was observed that after direct exchanges over emails 
> and whatsapp messages, the victim received an email having a specifically 
> crafted politically oriented subject with a malicious link ref [e].    
> 
> #### Spearphishing via QR Codes (Quishing)
> ##### Description
> 
> Spearphishing via QR codes, also known as "quishing," is an emerging
> cybersecurity threat where attackers use malicious QR codes to target
> specific individuals or organizations. This technique combines the
> deceptive nature of phishing with the convenience of QR codes to trick
> victims into revealing sensitive information or compromising their
> devices.  
> 
> ##### **How Quishing Works**
> 
> 1. Attackers generate a QR code that leads to a falsified website or
> malicious content.
> 2. The malicious QR code is distributed through various channels, such as
> emails, social media, or even physical locations.
> 3. Victims are lured into scanning the QR code, often under the guise of
> accessing exclusive content or necessary information.
> 4. Upon scanning, users are directed to phishing websites or trigger the
> download of malware.  
> 
> #### Spearphishing with enbedded HTML link
> ##### Description
> 
> Embedded HTML links in the context of spear phishing, refer
> to malicious links that are embedded within an email or message
> using HTML code. These links may appear legitimate from a trusted 
> source or known organization but actually they mask their true
> destionation. For example, they can be encoded or obfuscated
> to hide their source destination.  
> 
> Example: 
> 
> In one of the reports was observed that clicking a malicious HTML
> link redirected a victim first to malicious HubSpot Free Forms and then
> to credential harvesting pages mimicking Microsoft Azure and Outlook Web
> App (OWA) login portals ref [d].      
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Spear phishing requires more preparation and time to achieve success than
> a phishing attack. That is because spear-phishing attackers attempt to
> obtain vast amounts of personal information about their victims,  
> the entities their work for, or their areas of interest.  
> 
> Attackers can get the personal information they need using different ways:
> to compromise an email or messaging system trough other means, to use OSINT,
> scouring Social Media or glean personal information from the user's online
> presence.

The highly personalized nature of spear-phishing attacks makes it more  difficult to identity than widescale phishing attacks. | [T1566.001 : Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001 'Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems Spearphishing attachment is a spe')                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üì¶ Delivery`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `üì± Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üìß Email Platform`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üì± Mobile phone`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Mobile phone or smartphone

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Office 365` : Placeholder
 - ` Android` : Placeholder
 - ` iOS` : Placeholder
 - [` Github`](https://docs.github.com/en) : GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.
 - [` Gitlab`](https://docs.gitlab.com/) : GitLab Inc. is an open-core company that provides GitLab, a DevOps software package that combines the ability to develop, secure, and operate software in a single application.

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`üì¶ Software installation`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Software installation or code modification
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`üí≤ Operating costs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Increased operating costs

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üò∞ Very Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Highly probable - 80-95%
