🔥 **Criticality:Low** 🔫 : A Low priority incident is unlikely to affect public health or safety, national security, economic security, foreign relations, civil liberties, or public confidence. 

🚦 **TLP:CLEAR** ⚪ : Recipients can spread this to the world, there is no limit on disclosure.

## 👁️ Description

> Threat actors may attempt to gain initial access to EC AWS environments by
> sending a malicious/illicit VPC peering request to EC VPC administrators.
> If the VPC administrator approves the request, the adversary would see their 
> network joined with the target, and be able to pivot there freely.
> 
> VPC peering requests could also be used in the data exfil stage by 
> a threat actor using this method to send data out of an EC AWS account
> that the threat actor controls
> 
> Virtual Private Clouds, or VPCs, is a logically isolated portion of 
> networking that AWS assigns to clients. VPC peering is a feature that allows VPCs
> living in different accounts to be joined in a common IP space, for example to 
> allow different services to communicate to each others.
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > The attacker needs to control an AWS account in order to send a VPC peering request. The AWS account controlled by the attacker may or may not
> be inside the EC AWS PROD organization.

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`🪝 Social Engineering`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques aimed at the manipulation of people to perform unsafe actions.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `☁️ Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.
 - `🌐 Networking` : Communications backbone connecting users, applications and machines.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`🌐 Network Equipment`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`👤 System admin`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Administrator

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 [` AWS VPC`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) : A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC.

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`🧨 Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`💀 Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`👁️‍🗨️ Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`🛑 Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`🧠 IP Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Particular, key data, information and blueprint conducive to the organization capability to gain and retain a commercial or geopolitical advantage has been accessed, and their content potentially used by competitors or other adversaries.
 - [`💸 Monetary Loss`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : The vector will directly conduct to loss of value directly impacting the bottom line.
 - [`💲 Operating costs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Increased operating costs

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
