## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Use of Getsystem command to elevate from a local administrator to the SYSTEM user.
> There are different tools to do this, most popular are Cobalt Strike beacons and 
> Metasploit Meterpreter payload.
> 
> Both tools first attempt to use ‚Äúnamed pipe impersonation‚Äù to achieve SYSTEM privileges.
> This involves creating a Windows Service to execute as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and feeding
> data to it through a named pipe that is randomly created by the malicious payload.
> 
> The getsystem command has three techniques. The first two rely on named pipe impersonation.
> The last one relies on token duplication.
> 
> ## Technique 1.
> 
> It creates a named pipe from Meterpreter. It also creates and runs a service that runs
> cmd.exe /c echo ‚Äúsome data‚Äù >\\.\pipe\[random pipe here]. When the spawned cmd.exe connects
> to Meterpreter‚Äôs named pipe, Meterpreter has the opportunity to impersonate that security 
> context. Impersonation of clients is a named pipes feature. 
> The context of the service is SYSTEM, so when you impersonate it, you become SYSTEM.
> 
> ## Technique 2.
> 
> It is like technique 1. It creates a named pipe and impersonates the security context of
> the first client to connect to it. To create a client with the SYSTEM user context,
> this technique drops a DLL to disk(and schedules rundll32.exe as a service to run the
> DLL as SYSTEM. The DLL connects to the named pipe.
> 
> ## Technique 3.
> 
> It is a little different. This technique assumes you have SeDebugPrivileges‚Äîsomething getprivs
> can help with. It loops through all open services to find one that is running as SYSTEM and
> that you have permissions to inject into. It uses reflective DLL injection to run its elevator.dll
> in the memory space of the service it finds. This technique also passes the current thread id 
> (from Meterpreter) to elevator.dll. When run, elevator.dll gets the SYSTEM token, opens the primary 
> thread in Meterpreter, and tries to apply the SYSTEM token to it.
> 
> This technique‚Äôs implementation limits itself to x86 environments only. On the bright side, 
> it does not require spawning a new process and it takes place entirely in memory.

Based on victimology, the short lifespan of each ransomware variant, and use of malware attributed to government-sponsored threat groups, [Cinnamon Tempest](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1021) may be motivated by intellectual property theft or cyberespionage rather than financial gain.(Citation: Microsoft Ransomware as a Service)(Citation: Microsoft Threat Actor Naming July 2023)(Citation: Trend Micro Cheerscrypt May 2022)(Citation: SecureWorks BRONZE STARLIGHT Ransomware Operations June 2022)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | BRONZE STARLIGHT, DEV-0401, Emperor Dragonfly                                                                                                                                                                          | üó°Ô∏è MITRE ATT&CK Groups     | No documented sighting | No documented references |

| MUSTANG PANDA                 | This threat actor targets nongovernmental organizations using Mongolian-themed lures for espionage purposes.In April 2017, CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence observed a previously unattributed actor group with a Chinese nexus targeting a U.S.-based think tank. Further analysis revealed a wider campaign with unique tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This adversary targets non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in general, but uses Mongolian language decoys and themes, suggesting this actor has a specific focus on gathering intelligence on Mongolia. These campaigns involve the use of shared malware like Poison Ivy or PlugX.Recently, Falcon Intelligence observed new activity from MUSTANG PANDA, using a unique infection chain to target likely Mongolia-based victims. This newly observed activity uses a series of redirections and fileless, malicious implementations of legitimate tools to gain access to the targeted systems. Additionally, MUSTANG PANDA actors reused previously-observed legitimate domains to host files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | BRONZE PRESIDENT, HoneyMyte, Red Lich, TEMP.HEX, BASIN, Earth Preta, TA416, Stately Taurus, LuminousMoth, Polaris, TANTALUM, Twill Typhoon                                                                             | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

| DarkHydrus                    | In July 2018, Unit 42 analyzed a targeted attack using a novel file type against at least one government agency in the Middle East. It was carried out by a previously unpublished threat group we track as DarkHydrus. Based on our telemetry, we were able to uncover additional artifacts leading us to believe this adversary group has been in operation with their current playbook since early 2016. This attack diverged from previous attacks we observed from this group as it involved spear-phishing emails sent to targeted organizations with password protected RAR archive attachments that contained malicious Excel Web Query files (.iqy).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | LazyMeerkat, G0079, Obscure Serpens                                                                                                                                                                                    | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

| APT29                         | A 2015 report by F-Secure describe APT29 as: 'The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. The Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States;Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments;organizations associated with Chechen extremism;and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large - scale spear - phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash - and - grab approach involving a fast but noisy breakin followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible.If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long - term intelligence gathering. This threat actor targets government ministries and agencies in the West, Central Asia, East Africa, and the Middle East; Chechen extremist groups; Russian organized crime; and think tanks. It is suspected to be behind the 2015 compromise of unclassified networks at the White House, Department of State, Pentagon, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The threat actor includes all of the Dukes tool sets, including MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, SeaDuke, CloudDuke (aka MiniDionis), and HammerDuke (aka Hammertoss).

| WIZARD SPIDER                 | Wizard Spider is reportedly associated with Grim Spider and Lunar Spider.The WIZARD SPIDER threat group is the Russia-based operator of the TrickBot banking malware. This group represents a growing criminal enterprise of which GRIM SPIDER appears to be a subset. The LUNAR SPIDER threat group is the Eastern European-based operator and developer of the commodity banking malware called BokBot (aka IcedID), which was first observed in April 2017. The BokBot malware provides LUNAR SPIDER affiliates with a variety of capabilities to enable credential theft and wire fraud, through the use of webinjects and a malware distribution function.GRIM SPIDER is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating the Ryuk ransomware since August 2018, targeting large organizations for a high-ransom return. This methodology, known as ‚Äúbig game hunting,‚Äù signals a shift in operations for WIZARD SPIDER, a criminal enterprise of which GRIM SPIDER appears to be a cell. The WIZARD SPIDER threat group, known as the Russia-based operator of the TrickBot banking malware, had focused primarily on wire fraud in the past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | TEMP.MixMaster, GOLD BLACKBURN, FIN12, Periwinkle Tempest, DEV-0193, Storm-0193, Trickbot LLC, UNC2053, Pistachio Tempest, DEV-0237, Storm-0230                                                                        | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |
| INDRIK SPIDER                 | INDRIK SPIDER is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating Dridex since June 2014. In 2015 and 2016, Dridex was one of the most prolific eCrime banking trojans on the market and, since 2014, those efforts are thought to have netted INDRIK SPIDER millions of dollars in criminal profits. Throughout its years of operation, Dridex has received multiple updates with new modules developed and new anti-analysis features added to the malware.In August 2017, a new ransomware variant identified as BitPaymer was reported to have ransomed the U.K.‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS), with a high ransom demand of 53 BTC (approximately $200,000 USD). The targeting of an organization rather than individuals, and the high ransom demands, made BitPaymer stand out from other contemporary ransomware at the time. Though the encryption and ransom functionality of BitPaymer was not technically sophisticated, the malware contained multiple anti-analysis features that overlapped with Dridex. Later technical analysis of BitPaymer indicated that it had been developed by INDRIK SPIDER, suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include ransomware as a monetization strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Manatee Tempest                                                                                                                                                                                                        | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |
