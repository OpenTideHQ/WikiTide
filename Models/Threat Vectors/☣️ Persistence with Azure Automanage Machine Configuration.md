## 👁️ Description

> Azure Policy enables administrators to define, enforce and remediate
> configuration standards on Azure resources and even on non Azure assets
> using Azure Arc. One key feature, that was released in 2021, is the
> guest configuration feature of Azure Policy. Azure Policy Guest 
> Configuration is now called Azure Automanage Machine Configuration. 
> 
> Adversaries may use this functionality to gain persistence in an Azure 
> environment if they have gained the necessary permissions within the 
> subscription. And since Azure VMs are in many cases directly integrated 
> in the on-Premises Active Directory it is possible to gain additional 
> access there.
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > The adversary needs the owner access role on the targeted Azure 
> Subscription to apply the Azure Policy and grant permissions for
> the system-managed identities.

Attackers can get the personal information they need using different ways:   - to compromise an email or messaging system trough other means, - to use OSINT, sourcing Social Media or glean personal information from the user's online presence. They want to craft emails that look as legitimate and attractive as possible  to increase the chances of fooling their targets, for instance sending a malicious  attachment where the filename references a topic the recipient is interested in. The highly personalized nature of spear-phishing attacks makes it more  difficult to identity than widescale phishing attacks. | [T1566.001 : Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001 'Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems Spearphishing attachment is a spe')                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`🔐 Persistence`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `☁️ Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

 [`🛠️ Virtual Machines`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Azure` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`💀 Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`🦠 Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`💅 Modify privileges`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify privileges or permissions

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🛑 Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`🩼 Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
