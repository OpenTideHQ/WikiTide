## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Suspicious cron activity refers to the insertion or modification of scheduled tasks
> (cron jobs) on Unix-like systems (including Linux and macOS) in order to achieve 
> or maintain unauthorized persistence. This technique takes advantage of the legitimate 
> cron scheduling service to run malicious commands at regular intervals.  
> 
> In practice, a threat actor will add a hidden or obfuscated entry to `/etc/crontab`, 
> user-specific cron files (e.g., `/var/spool/cron/`), or 
> system-wide cron directories (e.g., `/etc/cron.d/`). 
> These hidden entries often execute scripts that download additional malware, 
> exfiltrate data, or establish a persistent backdoor.
> 
> Some known threat actors has leveraged cron-based jobs to deploy cryptocurrency miners 
> and move laterally within compromised environments, often targeting cloud-based 
> or containerized setups. 
> Attackers have also been identified using stealthy cron modifications to maintain 
> a foothold on victim systems, execute remote commands, and ensure that malicious binaries 
> are relaunched even after a reboot.
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Threat actor must already have privileged or administrative-level access 
> on a Linux or Unix-like system to insert or modify cron entries.

| TeamTNT              | In early Febuary, 2021 TeamTNT launched a new campaign against Docker and Kubernetes environments. Using a collection of container images that are hosted in Docker Hub, the attackers are targeting misconfigured docker daemons, Kubeflow dashboards, and Weave Scope, exploiting these environments in order to steal cloud credentials, open backdoors, mine cryptocurrency, and launch a worm that is looking for the next victim.They're linked to the First Crypto-Mining Worm to Steal AWS Credentials and Hildegard Cryptojacking malware.TeamTNT is a relatively recent addition to a growing number of threats targeting the cloud. While they employ some of the same tactics as similar groups, TeamTNT stands out with their social media presence and penchant for self-promotion.

| UNC1878              | UNC1878 is a financially motivated threat actor that monetizes network access via the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Earlier this year, Mandiant published a blog on a fast-moving adversary deploying RYUK ransomware, UNC1878. Shortly after its release, there was a significant decrease in observed UNC1878 intrusions and RYUK activity overall almost completely vanishing over the summer. But beginning in early fall, Mandiant has seen a resurgence of RYUK along with TTP overlaps indicating that UNC1878 has returned from the grave and resumed their operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | üåå MISP Threat Actor Galaxy | No documented sighting | No documented references |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üîê Persistence`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Linux` : Placeholder
 - ` macOS` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üî• Substantial incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a medium-sized organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a large organisation or wider / local government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`ü¶† Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`‚öôÔ∏è Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`üí≤ Operating costs`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Increased operating costs
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
