## 👁️ Description

> Disable Swapping/Paging Devices is a tactic adversaries may employ to impair defenses, 
> hamper forensic analyses, or disrupt normal system operations. 
> By turning off, deleting, or misconfiguring the system’s paging file or swap space, 
> malicious actors can limit the ability of the operating system to manage memory efficiently.  
> 
> ## Evade Detection : Certain security tools or analysis processes rely on paging 
> and memory snapshots. Disabling the swap or page file can complicate memory captures, 
> obstructing forensic investigators from retrieving certain artifacts.  
> 
> ## Cause Operational Instability : Without a functioning page file, systems may slow down 
> or crash once physical RAM is fully consumed. This can be used intentionally to disrupt 
> business operations or create an opening for other malicious activities 
> while defenders are distracted.  
> 
> ## Hide Malicious Components : Some malware frameworks attempt to evade detection 
> by maintaining all malicious code in volatile memory. If system memory is not paged to disk, 
> there is a slimmer trail of evidence left in permanent storage (e.g., pagefile.sys in Windows).  
> 
> ### Windows 
> ```powershell
> wmic computersystem where name="%computername%" set AutomaticManagedPagefile=False
> wmic pagefileset where name="C:\\pagefile.sys" delete
> ```
> This sequence disables the automatic page file management 
> and removes the page file on the C: drive.
> 
> ### Linux
> ```bash
> swapoff -a
> sed -i '/swap/d' /etc/fstab
> ```
> This one disable all swap spaces and remove swap references from `/etc/fstab`, 
> ensuring the change persists on reboot.
> 



## 🖥️ Terrain 

 > The attacker requires administrative privileges on the target operating system 
> to modify or disable the system paging or swap settings. 
> They may also need to leverage local management tools or scripts 
> to carry out these modifications.

## Model Data

#### **⛓️ Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`🏃🏽 Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

---

#### **🛰️ Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `🏢 Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **🎯 Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`🖥️ Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🖥️ Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`🔑 Server Authentication`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Authentication

---

#### **💿 Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` macOS` : Placeholder
 - ` Linux` : Placeholder

---

#### **💣 Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`⚠️ Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **🪄 Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`⚙️ Modify configuration`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Modify configuration or services
 - [`⛔ Denial of Service`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action attempting to deny access to valid users, such as by making a web server temporarily unavailable or unusable.
 - [`💅 Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights

---

#### **💥 Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`🛑 Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`🩼 Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`🌍 Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

---

#### **🎲 Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`🧐 Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
