## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Threat actors are using a hiding technique to conceal malicious files,
> folders, or other artifacts on a Windows system by leveraging the attributes
> of the NTFS file system. NTFS provides a range of attributes that can be
> used to hide or obscure files and folders, making them difficult to detect
> ref [1].  
> 
> Threat actors may use NTFS alternate data stream attribute to evade
> detection and deliver binary or other files that would have been otherwise
> blocked by the security controls.
> 
> They may store malicious data or binaries in file attribute metadata instead
> of directly in files. This may be done to evade some defenses, such as
> static indicator scanning tools and anti-virus ref [1], [2].      
> 
> An example is to attach a binary or a DLL as an ADS to a PDF file or text
> file that does not contain anything suspicious (decoy content) and acts just
> a carrier for the malicious payload store into the ADS.
> 
> In one of the malicious campaign a Russian affiliated threat actor is
> observed to use Alternate Data Streams (ADSes) vulnerability `CVE-2025-8088`
> for path traversal. The attackers specially crafted the archive to
> apparently contain only one benign file, while it contains many malicious
> addresses. Once a victim opens this seemingly benign file, WinRAR unpacks it
> along with all its ADSes ref [5].  
> 
> ### Known Techniques used by Threat Actors
> 
> - Setting attributes using the command line - a malicious operator can use
>   the attrib command to set attributes on files and folders.
> - Using API calls -  threat actor can use Windows API calls, such as
>   `SetFileAttributes` or `SetFileAttribute`, to set attributes on files and
>   folders.
> - Exploiting vulnerabilities - exploit vulnerabilities in software or the
>   operating system is another common used technique. Using these type of
>   vulnerabilities a threat actor can set attributes on files and folders
>   without being detected.        
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Threat actors need to deliver on the host a file that uses NTFS extended

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üèÉüèΩ Defense Evasion`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üñ•Ô∏è Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

 ` Windows` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üî´ Localised incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on an individual, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a small or medium-sized organisation.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`ü¶† Dwelling`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Active or passive extended presence in the target, which performs adversarial operations continuously.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
