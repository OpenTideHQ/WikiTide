## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> IT support impersonation via spoofed phone calls is a common social
> engineering technique used by attackers to gain initial access to an
> organisation's network. This tactic is often combined with other
> techniques, such as email flooding or phishing, to create a sense
> of urgency and legitimacy. To deceive victims, attackers may use
> one of the following methids:
> 
> - Use spoofed phone numbers: The threat actors can use spoofed phone
> numbers that appear to be from the organisation's IT department or a
> legitimate company.  
> - Create a sense of urgency: Attackers may claim that there is a critical
> issue with the victim's computer or account that requires immediate
> attention.
> - Use technical jargon: Some threat actor groups are observed to use
> technical terms and acronyms to sound legitimate and knowledgeable.
> - Request remote access: Attackers may ask the victim to grant remote
> access to their computer or network, often through tools like Zoom,
> Anydesk, Any Connect, TeamViewer or Microsoft Quick Assist.    
> 
> ### Possible scenario
> 
> Threat actor groups are targeting an organisation by gathering variety of
> user's data, for example, employee email addresses and the IT department's
> phone number. They can flood an employee with unsolicited emails and then
> impersonate IT support via a spoofed phone call, tricking the employee
> into granting remote access through `Microsoft Quick Assist` ref [1].   
> 
> Because `Quick Assist` uses the RDP stack (T1021.001), the attacker gains
> an RDP session under the user's context. If the targeted users has extended
> rights, the attacker can sidesteps perimeter ACLs, and disables input
> monitoring. A hidden admin account is added ref [1], [3]:  
> 
> ```
> *net user svc_updater P@ss123! /add*,
> *net localgroup administrators svc_updater /add*)
> ```
> 
> and a signed Hyper-V VHDX (`*windows_storage.vhdx*`) containing Cobalt
> Strike and the 3AM encryptor is transferred over SMB. Credential dumping
> from *lsass.exe* and *net group "domain admins" /DOMAIN* follow, before
> the payload encrypts mapped drives and drops *README_3AM.txt*.  
> 
> By performing such attack, the threat actor maintains persistence and
> can exfiltrates available data towards any server he controls.  
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > A threat actor needs initial user's interaction to gain access
> to the platform. For example assistance, accept invitation to
> a fake technical support or other "assistance".

They want to craft emails that look as legitimate and attractive as possible  to increase the chances of fooling their targets, for instance sending a malicious  attachment where the filename references a topic the recipient is interested in. The highly personalized nature of spear-phishing attacks makes it more  difficult to identity than widescale phishing attacks. | [T1566.001 : Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001 'Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems Spearphishing attachment is a spe')                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`ü™ù Social Engineering`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques aimed at the manipulation of people to perform unsafe actions.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `üì± Mobile` : Smartphones, tablets and applications running these devices.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üë§ Call center`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Call center
 - [`üë§ Customer`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - Customer
 - [`üë§ End-user`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : People - End-user
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üìß Email Platform`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üïπÔ∏è Remote access`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Remote access
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - [` Microsoft Teams`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/) : Microsoft Teams is a proprietary business communication platform developed by Microsoft, as part of the Microsoft 365 family of products. Teams primarily competes with the similar service Slack, offering workspace chat and videoconferencing, file storage, and application integration.
 - ` iOS` : Placeholder
 - ` Android` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.
 - [`üíÄ Infrastructure Compromise`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : The compromised target is likely to be used to further expand the sphere of influence of the attacker and allow more potent vectors to be executed.
 - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.
 - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`ü©º Impairement`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Incapacitation of a particular key system that will cause disruptions in day-to-day operations, and eventually service delivery.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
