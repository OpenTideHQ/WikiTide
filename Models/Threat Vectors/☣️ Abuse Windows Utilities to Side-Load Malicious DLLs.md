## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> ### 1. Squirrel.exe
> 
> **Description**: Associated with the Squirrel installation/update framework. 
> Threat actors can perform DLL side-loading by placing a malicious DLL 
> that squirrel.exe loads during execution.
> 
> Example:
> 
> > Attackers place a malicious DLL named Squirrel.dll in the same directory as squirrel.exe.
> 
> ```
> C:\Program Files\App\Squirrel.exe
> C:\Program Files\App\Squirrel.dll  (malicious)
> ```
> 
> ### 2. Tracker.exe
> 
> **Description**: A Windows process related to search indexing. 
> It can be abused for DLL side-loading.
> 
> Example:
> 
> > An attacker places a malicious DLL named tracker.dll in the same directory as tracker.exe.
> 
> ```
> C:\Windows\System32\tracker.exe
> C:\Windows\System32\tracker.dll  (malicious)
> ```
> 
> ### 3. Tttracer.exe and Ttdinject.exe
> 
> **Description**: Part of the Windows Time Travel Tracing toolset. 
> Threat actors can inject code into processes or load malicious DLLs.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> ttdinject.exe -p <PID> -l C:\path\to\malicious.dll
> ```
> 
> ## 4. Wmiprvse.exe\
> 
> **Description**: stands for Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Service
> Threat actors can exploit wmiprvse.exe for DLL side-loading by placing malicious WMI provider 
> DLLs that wmiprvse.exe loads during execution.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> C:\Windows\System32\wbem\wmiprvse.exe
> C:\Windows\System32\wbem\malicious_provider.dll  (malicious)
> ```
> 
> ### 5. InstallUtil.exe\
> 
> **Description**: A command-line utility that allows for the installation 
> and uninstallation of resources by executing installer components specified 
> in .NET assemblies. Threat actors can run malicious code by passing a crafted assembly.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=false /U C:\path\to\malicious.dll
> ```
> 
> ### 6. Odbcconf.exe\
> 
> **Description**: Configures ODBC drivers and data source names. Can be used to execute DLLs.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> odbcconf.exe /S /A {REGSVR C:\path\to\malicious.dll}
> ```



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > The targeted Windows systems must have applications that improperly handle DLL loading, 
> allowing unsigned or malicious DLLs to be loaded without proper validation. 
> This often involves software that looks for DLLs in directories writable 
> by non-administrative users
>

| [ICS] FIN7         | [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) is a financially-motivated threat group that has been active since 2013. [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) has primarily targeted the retail, restaurant, hospitality, software, consulting, financial services, medical equipment, cloud services, media, food and beverage, transportation, and utilities industries in the U.S. A portion of [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) was run out of a front company called Combi Security and often used point-of-sale malware for targeting efforts. Since 2020, [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) shifted operations to a big game hunting (BGH) approach including use of [REvil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0496) ransomware and their own Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Darkside.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`‚ö° Execution`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

 `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üõ†Ô∏è Virtual Machines`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - ` Windows` : Placeholder
 - ` PowerShell` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`‚ö†Ô∏è Significant incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a large organisation or on wider / local government, or which poses a considerable risk to central government or (inter)national essential services.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

  - [`üíÖ Elevation of privilege`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Capacity to augment leverage over the target system by upgrading the compromised access rights
 - [`üêí Tampering`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.
 - [`üëª Spoofing`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another user‚Äôs credentials, such as username and password.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`üîì Data Breach`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Non-public information has been accessed from the outside, and successfully extracted.
 - [`üõë Business disruption`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Business disruption
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.
 - [`‚öñÔ∏è Legal and regulatory`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Legal and regulatory costs

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
