## üëÅÔ∏è Description

> Adversaries may attempt to enumerate the environment and list all
> local system and domain accounts or groups.  
> To achieve this purpose, they can use variety of tools and techniques.  
> Their goal is reconnaissance, gathering of user's account information on 
> the system or in the domain and further usage of accounts with higher 
> privilege access.
> 
> 
> ### For Windows OS:
> 
> On Windows platforms threat actors can use the net utility or dsquery,
> as examples as lolbins. Net utility commands, as examples, are executed
> with additional parameters like "net localgroup", "net user" for
> administrators and guest accounts. For domain users and groups net
> utility commands are used with the parameter /domain.  
> 
> Examples:   
> 
> - net user /domain
> - net group /domain
> - net localgroup on localhost
> - net user on localhost
> - net localgroup "Administrators" on localhost
> 
> Executable files net.exe or net1.exe are indicators for accounts enumeration.
> "Net1.exe" resides in "C:\Windows\System32" like "net.exe" and indicates process 
> known as Net Command or Application Installer. These .exe files are usually related 
> to run applications, batch files, and scripts that call Net utility.  
> 
> Threat actors may enumerate currently or previously connected users, or a subset
> of users as for example administrative users.  
> 
> ### For Linux OS (including Windows Subsystem for Linux):
> 
> Here some example of commands typically used for discovery on accounts 
> and groups.
> 
> - whoami        #current user (often used in legitimate scripts)
> - hostname      #show or set the system's host name
> - id            #print real and effective user and group IDs
> - uname         #print system information
> - arp
> - users
> - netdiscover
> - ifconfig	  #configure a network interface
> - nmap
> - ps            #report a snapshot of the current processes
> - netstat
> - uname
> - issue
> - groups
> - tcpdump
> - sudo -l
> - cat /etc/shadow
> - cat /etc/passwd # other command could be used to list the content of the file ex: 'less', 'more' etc.
> - cat /etc/group  # Groups
> - cat /etc/sudoers # File that allocate system rights to users
> - last            # most recent login sessions
> - ldapsearch      # Get information from LDAP server
> - rpcclient       # Command-line utility used to interact with Microsoft RPC protocol. Could be used to enumerate AD
> - finger          #  user information lookup command 
> 



## üñ•Ô∏è Terrain 

 > Adversaries can take advantage of already compromised system (Windows or 
> Linux OS or OSX) to run commands.

## Model Data

#### **‚õìÔ∏è Cyber Kill Chain**

 > Cyber attacks are typically phased progressions towards strategic objectives. The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain these objectives. This provides a solid basis to develop (or realign) defensive strategies to raise cyber resilience.

 [`üß≠ Discovery`](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) : Techniques that allow an attacker to gain knowledge about a system and its network environment.

---

#### **üõ∞Ô∏è Domains**

 > Infrastructure technologies domain of interest to attackers.

  - `üè¢ Enterprise` : Generic databases, applications, machines and systems that are usually on premises or on Cloud traditional VMs.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Private Cloud` : Infrastructure hosted at a third party, but based on custom specification and managed on a platform level.
 - `‚òÅÔ∏è Public Cloud` : Infrastructure handled by a commercial cloud provider. Managed mostly on a service level, and connected over the internet.

---

#### **üéØ Targets**

 > Granular delimited technical entities holding a value to the organization, that are targeted by adversaries. They might be also involved in the detection coverage as the target of log collection. Partially inspired by Veris.

  - [`üñ•Ô∏è Desktop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Desktop or workstation
 - [`üìÇ Directory`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Server - Directory (LDAP, AD)
 - [`üë∑ Engineering Workstation`](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Engineering_Workstation) : The engineering workstation is usually a high-end very reliable computing platform designed for configuration, maintenance and diagnostics of the control system applications and other control system equipment. The system is usually made up of redundant hard disk drives, high speed network interface, reliable CPUs, performance graphics hardware, and applications that provide configuration and monitoring tools to perform control system application development, compilation and distribution of system modifications.
 - [`üî• Firewall`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Network - Firewall
 - [`üíª Laptop`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : User Device - Laptop
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Public-Facing Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Web Application Servers`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder
 - [`üñ•Ô∏è Workstations`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-asset) : Placeholder

---

#### **üíø Platforms concerned**

 > Actual technologies used by the organization that will be exploited by adversaries during a successful attack, and eventually of relevance for detection. Are named by commercial designation.

  - [` AWS EC2`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/index.html) : Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable computing capacity‚Äîliterally, servers in Amazon's data centers‚Äîthat you use to build and host your software systems.
 - [` AWS ECS`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/index.html) : Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
 - [` AWS EKS`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/index.html) : Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes clusters.
 - ` Linux` : Placeholder
 - ` macOS` : Placeholder
 - ` Windows` : Placeholder

---

#### **üí£ Severity**

 > The severity summarizes the overall danger of incident the vector will provoke, and is to be derived (WIP) from impact, leverage, and difficulty to execute.

 [`üß® Moderate incident`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/new-cyber-attack-categorisation-system-improve-uk-response-incidents) : A cyber attack on a small organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a medium-sized organisation, or preliminary indications of cyber activity against a large organisation or the government.

---

#### **ü™Ñ Leverage acquisition**

 > Technical aftermath of the attack from the target perspective, differentiated from impact as it does not consider the value of the consequence, only what increased control the vector execution provides to the adversary.

 [`üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Information Disclosure`](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride) : Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in transit.

---

#### **üí• Impact**

 > Analysis of the threat vector from the organizational perspective, in non technical term. This aims at putting a clear denomination on what the attacker will actually be able to act upon if the threat vector is realized.

  - [`ü•∏ Identity Theft`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Acquisition of sufficient information and privileges to profess as a given individual, for the purpose of abusing and deceiving human trust relationships.
 - [`üò§ Nuisance`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Small and mostly inconsequential to day to day operations, but noticed.
 - [`üåç Reputational Damages`](http://veriscommunity.net/enums.html#section-impact) : Damages to the organization public view may be achieved by using directly the access gained, or indirectly with data gathered.

---

#### **üé≤ Vector Viability**

 > Described with estimative language (likelyhood probability), describes how likely the analyst believes the vector to actually be realized on the organization infrastructure. Estimative language describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies based Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD 203) and JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence.

 [`üßê Likely`](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) : Probable (probably) - 55-80%
