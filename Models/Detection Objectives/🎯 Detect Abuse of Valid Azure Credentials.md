## 💡 Objective

**🏷️ Type** : Threat - Alerts meant for detection cybersecurity threats, and which should eventually trigger Incident Response  

> Detect when adversaries abuse valid Azure AD/Entra ID credentials to gain 
> unauthorized access to cloud resources. This detection objective focuses on 
> identifying anomalous authentication patterns, suspicious access behaviors, 
> and privilege abuse that indicate compromised credentials are being used 
> for malicious purposes.
> 
> Attackers obtain credentials through various means (phishing, password spraying, 
> credential leaks) and use them to authenticate legitimately to Azure services, 
> making detection challenging as the authentication itself appears valid. This 
> objective aims to identify the contextual anomalies and behavioral indicators 
> that differentiate legitimate use from credential abuse.
> 
> Key focus areas include:
> - Anomalous sign-in patterns (location, device, time, velocity)
> - Privilege escalation attempts post-authentication
> - Unusual resource access patterns
> - Service principal and application credential abuse
> - Cross-tenant authentication anomalies
> 

**🎼 Composition** : Risk - Advanced strategy where signals contribute a risk score over time to entities in a permanent risk store. This allows weak and strong signals to coexist, while response switches from processing alerts to process a bundle of contributing signals around a high risk entity. This is essentially an evolution of the `Entity` and `Threshold` strategy, and adds a layer of risk calculation around entities using repeated signals as risk contributors. Different signals may contribute differentially, and also include decaying factors.

> This detection objective employs a layered correlation strategy combining 
multiple independent signals. Each signal can detect specific aspects of 
credential abuse, but when correlated, they provide high-fidelity detection 
of sophisticated attacks. The signals should be evaluated both independently 
(for high-severity individual alerts) and in combination (for attack chain 
detection). A scoring model that aggregates risk from multiple signals 
provides the most effective detection posture.

### Anomalous Azure AD Sign-In Patterns

🪪 **UUID** : `12fb0e6a-a4e4-42d3-b77b-3c9c96f90f0b`

> Detects authentication activities to Azure AD/Entra ID that deviate from 
established baseline patterns for user accounts. This includes monitoring 
for impossible travel scenarios, sign-ins from unusual geographic locations, 
unfamiliar devices, anonymous IP addresses, or suspicious ISPs.

Key detection indicators:
- Sign-in from a geographic location where the user has never authenticated before
- Impossible travel: authentication from two distant locations within an 
  unrealistic timeframe
- Authentication from TOR exit nodes, VPN services, or anonymizing proxies
- Sign-in from a device that doesn't match the user's typical device profile
- Authentication outside normal business hours for privileged accounts
- Multiple failed authentication attempts followed by a successful login
- Sign-ins with legacy authentication protocols (bypassing MFA)

Particular attention should be paid to privileged accounts (Global Administrators, 
Security Administrators, Application Administrators) as these represent high-value 
targets for attackers.


**🔎 Data Visibility**

- **Availability** : Complete
- **Requirements** : `Requires Azure AD Sign-In Logs with full diagnostic settings enabled, 
including location data, device information, authentication method details, 
and risk detection signals. Microsoft Entra ID Protection should be enabled 
to leverage built-in risk detection capabilities. Logs should include:
- Azure AD Sign-in logs (interactive and non-interactive)
- Azure AD Audit logs
- Entra ID Protection risk detections
- Conditional Access policy evaluation results

Baseline profiling of user authentication patterns over at least 30 days 
is required for effective anomaly detection. Integration with IP reputation 
services and geolocation databases enhances detection accuracy.

### Service Principal Credential Abuse

🪪 **UUID** : `d4d7e42b-3f9b-41c7-8dfb-ee7021ee806f`

> Detects suspicious activities involving Azure service principal credentials 
(client secrets, certificates). Service principals are non-human identities 
that applications use to authenticate, making them prime targets for attackers 
seeking persistent, stealthy access to Azure resources.

Detection focuses on:
- Service principal authentication from unexpected IP addresses or geographic locations
- Service principal used to access resources outside its typical scope
- Rapid enumeration of resources or permissions by a service principal
- Service principal credentials used after being added to an existing application
- Authentication using service principal secrets that were recently created or modified
- Service principal accessing multiple subscriptions or tenants (if not expected)
- High volume of API calls from a service principal in a short time period
- Service principal making privileged changes (role assignments, policy modifications)

Attackers who compromise service principal credentials can maintain long-term 
access while evading user-focused security controls like MFA. These credentials 
are often stored in code repositories, configuration files, or automation scripts 
where they can be harvested.


**🔎 Data Visibility**

- **Availability** : Complete
- **Requirements** : `Requires comprehensive Azure Activity Logs and Azure AD Audit Logs with 
focus on service principal operations. Monitoring should include:
- Azure AD Service Principal sign-in logs
- Azure Activity Logs for resource access by service principals
- Azure AD Audit logs for credential modifications (secret/certificate additions)
- Microsoft Graph API activity logs
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) operation logs

Baseline profiling of service principal behavior patterns is essential, 
including typical resources accessed, API call patterns, and geographic 
origins of requests. Application configuration management systems (e.g., 
Azure Key Vault access logs) should also be monitored to detect credential 
harvesting attempts.

### Privilege Escalation After Initial Access

🪪 **UUID** : `11686b3d-5f9d-4c1e-b3a8-4bae83653d24`

> Detects attempts to escalate privileges within Azure following successful 
authentication with valid credentials. This signal identifies when an attacker, 
after gaining initial access with compromised credentials, attempts to expand 
their privileges through role assignments, PIM activations, or exploitation 
of misconfigured permissions.

Key detection patterns:
- User account assigned to a privileged role (Global Admin, Security Admin, etc.) 
  shortly after a suspicious sign-in event
- Activation of Privileged Identity Management (PIM) roles from unusual locations 
  or devices
- User granted permissions to sensitive resources (Key Vaults, Storage Accounts) 
  that they've never accessed before
- Addition of credentials to existing applications or service principals
- Changes to Conditional Access policies that weaken security controls
- Modification of MFA settings for privileged accounts
- Creation of new service principals or applications with elevated permissions
- Assignment of directory roles that allow further privilege escalation

Temporal correlation is critical: privilege changes occurring within minutes 
to hours of anomalous authentication events represent high-confidence indicators 
of compromise. Attackers often move quickly to escalate privileges before 
defenders can respond to initial access alerts.


**🔎 Data Visibility**

- **Availability** : Complete
- **Requirements** : `Requires Azure AD Audit Logs with detailed role assignment and permission 
change tracking. Monitoring dependencies include:
- Azure AD Audit logs (role assignments, permission grants, PIM activations)
- Azure AD Sign-in logs (for temporal correlation with authentication events)
- Azure AD PIM logs (privileged role activation history)
- Microsoft Graph API audit logs (application permission modifications)
- Azure Activity Logs (RBAC role assignments at subscription/resource level)
- Conditional Access policy change logs

Requires correlation engine capable of linking sign-in events with subsequent 
privilege escalation activities within defined time windows (typically 1-24 hours). 
Baseline understanding of legitimate privilege escalation patterns (e.g., 
on-call procedures, scheduled administrative tasks) is necessary to reduce 
false positives.

### Suspicious Resource Enumeration and Access Patterns

🪪 **UUID** : `353add53-6e14-47df-b65a-a591d2c6aacd`

> Detects unusual patterns of resource enumeration and access that indicate 
an attacker is exploring the Azure environment to identify high-value targets 
after gaining access with valid credentials. This includes broad reconnaissance 
activities across subscriptions, resource groups, and sensitive assets.

Detection indicators:
- Rapid succession of read operations across multiple Azure resource types 
  (VMs, storage accounts, databases, key vaults) within a short timeframe
- User accessing resources they have never accessed historically
- Enumeration of all subscriptions, resource groups, or management groups 
  accessible to the compromised account
- PowerShell or Azure CLI commands used for systematic resource discovery 
  (Get-AzResource, az resource list, etc.)
- Microsoft Graph API queries to enumerate users, groups, applications, 
  service principals, or role assignments
- Access to sensitive resources (Key Vault secrets, storage account keys, 
  database connection strings) following initial authentication
- Cross-subscription resource access patterns that deviate from normal behavior
- Failed access attempts to resources followed by successful permission modifications

Attackers performing post-compromise reconnaissance typically exhibit scanning 
behaviors distinct from normal administrative activities: broader scope, higher 
velocity, and less targeted access patterns. Correlation with earlier authentication 
anomalies significantly increases detection confidence.


**🔎 Data Visibility**

- **Availability** : Complete
- **Requirements** : `Requires comprehensive Azure Activity Logs covering all resource operations, 
with particular focus on read operations and access patterns. Data requirements include:
- Azure Activity Logs (all read operations across subscriptions)
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) operation logs
- Microsoft Graph API audit logs (for directory object enumeration)
- Azure Key Vault access logs (secret/key/certificate access)
- Azure Storage Account diagnostic logs (blob/file access patterns)
- Azure SQL/Cosmos DB audit logs (data plane access attempts)
- PowerShell/Azure CLI command execution logs (if available via EDR)

Behavioral baselining over 30-90 days is essential to understand normal 
resource access patterns for each user and service principal. The detection 
system should track resource access frequency, scope, and temporal patterns 
to identify deviations. Integration with UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics) 
platforms significantly enhances detection accuracy for this signal.
