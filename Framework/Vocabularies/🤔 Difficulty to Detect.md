| ðŸ”‘ Id    | ðŸŽ« Name             | ðŸ”¬ Description                                                                                                                                  |
|:--------|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FSB0001 | ðŸ¥³ Available        | Detections are easy to build, since data is available and building blocks already exist                                                        |
| FSB0002 | ðŸ˜¤ Minor Work       | Building the detection requires some light known and defined development                                                                       |
| FSB0003 | ðŸ˜… Possible         | Technical details are known, but some moderate research is required to understand how to build detections                                      |
| FSB0004 | ðŸ˜° Challenging      | Available information exist to support development, but unfamiliarity will lead to a sharper learning curve                                    |
| FSB0005 | ðŸ¥µ Complex          | Multiple challenges in the path of development, which will need to resolved alongside technical work                                           |
| FSB0006 | ðŸ¤‘ Needs Investment | Blocked at the current technological maturity stage, but might be part of a larger investment, i.e. to increase log collection or new toolings |
| FSB0007 | ðŸ˜µ Impossible       | No perceived technical possibilities to fulfill detection objectives, due to the nature of the threat vector or non-technical aspects          |
