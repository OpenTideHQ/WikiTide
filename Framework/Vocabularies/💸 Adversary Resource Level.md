| RES0001 | Solo                    | Resources limited to the average individual; Threat Actor acts independently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | individual   |
| RES0002 | Group                   | Members interact on a social and volunteer basis, often with little personal interest in the specific target. An example might be a core group of unrelated activists who regularly exchange tips on a particular blog. Group persists long term.                                                                                                                                                                                                | club         |
| RES0003 | Mission-Based           | A short-lived and perhaps anonymous interaction that concludes when the participants have achieved a single goal. For example, people who break into systems just for thrills or prestige may hold a contest to see who can break into a specific target first. It also includes announced "operations" to achieve a specific goal, such as the original "OpIsrael" call for volunteers to disrupt all of Israel's Internet functions for a day. | contest      |
| RES0004 | Tiger Team              | A formally organized group with a leader, typically motivated by a specific goal and organized around that goal. Group persists long term and typically operates within a single geography.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | team         |
| RES0005 | Structured Organization | Larger and better resourced than a team; typically, a company or crime syndicate. Usually operates in multiple geographic areas and persists long term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | organization |
| RES0006 | Government-sponsored    | Controls public assets and functions within a jurisdiction; very well resourced and persists long term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | government   |
