These include detailed data on records requested, client IP, request flags, zone transfers, query logs, rate timing, and DNS signing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://nxlog.co/whitepapers/dns-logging                                                                                                                                             | nan                                                                        |

| COL0027  | Exchange Mailbox Audit Logging                     | Mailbox audit logs are generated for each mailbox that has mailbox audit logging enabled. Log entries are stored in the Recoverable Items folder in the audited mailbox, in the Audits subfolder. This ensures that all audit log entries are available from a single location, regardless of which client access method was used to access the mailbox or which server or computer an administrator uses to access the mailbox audit log. If you move a mailbox to another Mailbox server, the mailbox audit logs for that mailbox are also moved because they're located in the mailbox.                                                                                                                             | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/policy-and-compliance/mailbox-audit-logging/mailbox-audit-logging?view=exchserver-2019                                                     | nan                                                                        |

| COL0029  | Amazon CloudWatch Events                           | Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources, or when API calls are published by AWS CloudTrail. Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams. CloudWatch Events becomes aware of operational changes as they occur. CloudWatch Events can respond to these operational changes and take corrective action as necessary, by sending messages to respond to the environment, activating functions, making changes, and capturing state information. Some security services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, produce their output in the form of CloudWatch Events.     | https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html                                                                                               | nan                                                                        |
