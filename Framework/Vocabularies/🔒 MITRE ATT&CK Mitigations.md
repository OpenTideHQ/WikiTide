| M0800  | Industrial : Authorization Enforcement                  | The device or system should restrict read, manipulate, or execute privileges to only authenticated users who require access based on approved security policies.  Role-based Access Control (RBAC) schemes can help reduce the overhead of assigning permissions to the large number of devices within an ICS. For example, IEC 62351 provides examples of roles used to support common system operations within the electric power sector  (Citation: International Electrotechnical Commission July 2020), while IEEE 1686 defines standard permissions for users of IEDs.

| M0801  | Industrial : Access Management                          | Access Management technologies can be used to enforce authorization polices and decisions, especially when existing field devices do not provide sufficient capabilities to support user identification and authentication.

DLP may be configured to prevent the transfer of information through corporate resources such as email, web, and physical media such as USB for host-based solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M0803 |
| M0804  | Industrial : Human User Authentication                  | Require user authentication before allowing access to data or accepting commands to a device. While strong multi-factor authentication is preferable, it is not always feasible within ICS environments. Performing strong user authentication also requires additional security controls and processes which are often the target of related adversarial techniques (e.g., Valid Accounts, Default Credentials).

Ensure that all SISs are segmented from operational networks to prevent them from being targeted by additional adversarial behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M0812 |
| M0813  | Industrial : Software Process and Device Authentication | Require the authentication of devices and software processes where appropriate. Devices that connect remotely to other systems should require strong authentication to prevent spoofing of communications.

| M0818  | Industrial : Validate Program Inputs                    | Devices and programs designed to interact with control system parameters should validate the format and content of all user inputs and actions to ensure the values are within intended operational ranges. These values should be evaluated and further enforced through the program logic running on the field controller. If a problematic or invalid input is identified, the programs should either utilize a predetermined safe value or enter a known safe state, while also logging or alerting on the event.(Citation: PLCTop20 Mar 2023)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M0818 |

| M0930  | Industrial : Network Segmentation                       | Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network.  Restrict network access to only required systems and services. In addition, prevent systems from other networks or business functions (e.g., enterprise) from accessing critical process control systems. For example, in IEC 62443, systems within the same secure level should be grouped into a zone, and access to that zone is restricted by a conduit, or mechanism to restrict data flows between zones by segmenting the network.

Within industrial control environments assets such as low-level controllers, workstations, and HMIs have real-time operational control and safety requirements which may restrict the use of multi-factor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M0932 |

| M0937  | Industrial : Filter Network Traffic                     | Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic.   Perform inline allow/denylisting of network messages based on the application layer (OSI Layer 7) protocol, especially for automation protocols. Application allowlists are beneficial when there are well-defined communication sequences, types, rates, or patterns needed during expected system operations. Application denylists may be needed if all acceptable communication sequences cannot be defined, but instead a set of known malicious uses can be denied (e.g., excessive communication  attempts, shutdown messages, invalid commands).  Devices performing these functions are often referred to as deep-packet inspection (DPI) firewalls, context-aware firewalls, or firewalls blocking specific automation/SCADA protocol aware firewalls.

| M1009  | Mobile : Encrypt Network Traffic                        | Application developers should encrypt all of their application network traffic using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to ensure protection of sensitive data and deter network-based attacks. If desired, application developers could perform message-based encryption of data before passing it for TLS encryption.iOS's App Transport Security feature can be used to help ensure that all application network traffic is appropriately protected. Apple intends to mandate use of App Transport Security  (Citation: TechCrunch-ATS) for all apps in the Apple App Store unless appropriate justification is given.Android's Network Security Configuration feature similarly can be used by app developers to help ensure that all of their application network traffic is appropriately protected  (Citation: Android-NetworkSecurityConfig).Use of Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels, e.g. using the IPsec protocol, can help mitigate some types of network attacks as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1009 |
| M1010  | Mobile : Deploy Compromised Device Detection Method     | A variety of methods exist that can be used to enable enterprises to identify compromised (e.g. rooted/jailbroken) devices, whether using security mechanisms built directly into the device, third-party mobile security applications, enterprise mobility management (EMM)/mobile device management (MDM) capabilities, or other methods.

| M1013  | Mobile : Application Developer Guidance                 | Application Developer Guidance focuses on providing developers with the knowledge, tools, and best practices needed to write secure code, reduce vulnerabilities, and implement secure design principles. By integrating security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), this mitigation aims to prevent the introduction of exploitable weaknesses in applications, systems, and APIs. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Preventing SQL Injection (Secure Coding Practice):- Implementation: Train developers to use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of directly embedding user input into SQL queries.- Use Case: A web application accepts user input to search a database. By sanitizing and validating user inputs, developers can prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL commands.Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Mitigation:- Implementation: Require developers to implement output encoding for all user-generated content displayed on a web page.- Use Case: An e-commerce site allows users to leave product reviews. Properly encoding and escaping user inputs prevents malicious scripts from being executed in other usersâ€™ browsers.Secure API Design:- Implementation: Train developers to authenticate all API endpoints and avoid exposing sensitive information in API responses.- Use Case: A mobile banking application uses APIs for account management.

By integrating security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), this mitigation aims to prevent the introduction of exploitable weaknesses in applications, systems, and APIs. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Preventing SQL Injection (Secure Coding Practice):- Implementation: Train developers to use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of directly embedding user input into SQL queries.- Use Case: A web application accepts user input to search a database. By sanitizing and validating user inputs, developers can prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL commands.Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Mitigation:- Implementation: Require developers to implement output encoding for all user-generated content displayed on a web page.- Use Case: An e-commerce site allows users to leave product reviews. Properly encoding and escaping user inputs prevents malicious scripts from being executed in other usersâ€™ browsers.Secure API Design:- Implementation: Train developers to authenticate all API endpoints and avoid exposing sensitive information in API responses.- Use Case: A mobile banking application uses APIs for account management. By enforcing token-based authentication for every API call, developers reduce the risk of unauthorized access.Static Code Analysis in the Build Pipeline:- Implementation: Incorporate tools into CI/CD pipelines to automatically scan for vulnerabilities during the build process.- Use Case: A fintech company integrates static analysis tools to detect hardcoded credentials in their source code before deployment.Threat Modeling in the Design Phase:- Implementation: Use frameworks like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to assess threats during application design.- Use Case: Before launching a customer portal, a SaaS company identifies potential abuse cases, such as session hijacking, and designs mitigations like secure session management.**Tools for Implementation**:- Static Code Analysis Tools: Use tools that can scan for known vulnerabilities in source code.- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Use tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to simulate runtime attacks and identify vulnerabilities.- Secure Frameworks: Recommend secure-by-default frameworks (e.g., Django for Python, Spring Security for Java) that enforce security best practices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1013 |

| M1015  | Active Directory Configuration                          | Implement robust Active Directory (AD) configurations using group policies to secure user accounts, control access, and minimize the attack surface. AD configurations enable centralized control over account settings, logon policies, and permissions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Account Configuration:- Implementation: Use domain accounts instead of local accounts to leverage ADâ€™s centralized management, including group policies, auditing, and access control.- Use Case: For IT staff managing shared resources, provision domain accounts that allow IT teams to log in centrally, reducing the risk of unmanaged, rogue local accounts on individual machines.Interactive Logon Restrictions:- Implementation: Configure group policies to restrict interactive logons (e.g., direct physical or RDP logons) for service accounts or privileged accounts that do not require such access.- Use Case: Prevent service accounts, such as SQL Server accounts, from having interactive logon privileges. This reduces the risk of these accounts being leveraged for lateral movement if compromised.Remote Desktop Settings:- Implementation: Limit Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to specific, authorized accounts. Use group policies to enforce this, allowing only necessary users to establish RDP sessions.- Use Case: On sensitive servers (e.g., domain controllers or financial databases), restrict RDP access to administrative accounts only, while all other users are denied access.Dedicated Administrative Accounts:- Implementation: Create domain-wide administrative accounts that are restricted from interactive logons, designed solely for high-level tasks (e.g., software installation, patching).- Use Case: Create separate administrative accounts for different purposes, such as one set of accounts for installations and another for managing repository access. This limits exposure and helps reduce attack vectors.Authentication Silos:- Implementation: Configure Authentication Silos in AD, using group policies to create access zones with restrictions based on membership, such as the Protected Users security group. This restricts access to critical accounts and minimizes exposure to potential threats.- Use Case: Place high-risk or high-value accounts, such as executive or administrative accounts, in an Authentication Silo with extra controls, limiting their exposure to only necessary systems. This reduces the risk of credential misuse or abuse if these accounts are compromised.**Tools for Implementation**:- Active Directory Group Policies: Use Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) to configure, deploy, and enforce policies across AD environments.- PowerShell: Automate account configuration, logon restrictions, and policy application using PowerShell scripts.- AD Administrative Center: Manage Authentication Silos and configure high-level policies for critical user groups within AD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1015 |
| M1016  | Vulnerability Scanning                                  | Vulnerability scanning involves the automated or manual assessment of systems, applications, and networks to identify misconfigurations, unpatched software, or other security weaknesses. The process helps prioritize remediation efforts by classifying vulnerabilities based on risk and impact, reducing the likelihood of exploitation by adversaries. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Proactive Identification of Vulnerabilities- Implementation: Use tools like Nessus or OpenVAS to scan endpoints, servers, and applications for missing patches and configuration issues. Schedule regular scans to ensure timely identification of vulnerabilities introduced by new deployments or updates.- Use Case: A scan identifies unpatched software, such as outdated Apache servers, which could be exploited via CVE-XXXX-XXXX. The server is promptly patched, mitigating the risk.Cloud Environment Scanning- Implementation: Use cloud-specific vulnerability management tools like AWS Inspector, Azure Security Center, or GCP Security Command Center to identify issues like open S3 buckets or overly permissive IAM roles.- Use Case: The scan detects a misconfigured S3 bucket with public read access, which is remediated to prevent potential data leakage.Network Device Scanning- Implementation: Use tools to scan network devices for vulnerabilities, such as weak SNMP strings or outdated firmware. Correlate scan results with vendor advisories to prioritize updates.- Use Case: Scanning detects a router running outdated firmware vulnerable to CVE-XXXX-YYYY.

This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Deploy Web Proxy Filtering:- Use solutions to filter web traffic based on categories, reputation, and content types.- Enforce policies that block unsafe websites or file types at the gateway level.Enable DNS-Based Filtering:- Implement tools to restrict access to domains associated with malware or phishing campaigns.- Use public DNS filtering services to enhance protection.Enforce Content Security Policies (CSP):- Configure CSP headers on internal and external web applications to restrict script execution, iframe embedding, and cross-origin requests.Control Browser Features:- Disable unapproved browser features like automatic downloads, developer tools, or unsafe scripting.- Enforce policies through tools like Group Policy Management to control browser settings.Monitor and Alert on Web-Based Threats:- Use SIEM tools to collect and analyze web proxy logs for signs of anomalous or malicious activity.- Configure alerts for access attempts to blocked domains or repeated file download failures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1021 |
| M1022  | Restrict File and Directory Permissions                 | Restricting file and directory permissions involves setting access controls at the file system level to limit which users, groups, or processes can read, write, or execute files. By configuring permissions appropriately, organizations can reduce the attack surface for adversaries seeking to access sensitive data, plant malicious code, or tamper with system files.Enforce Least Privilege Permissions:- Remove unnecessary write permissions on sensitive files and directories.- Use file ownership and groups to control access for specific roles.Example (Windows): Right-click the shared folder â†’ Properties â†’ Security tab â†’ Adjust permissions for NTFS ACLs.Harden File Shares:- Disable anonymous access to shared folders.- Enforce NTFS permissions for shared folders on Windows.Example: Set permissions to restrict write access to critical files, such as system executables (e.g., `/bin` or `/sbin` on Linux). Use tools like `chown` and `chmod` to assign file ownership and limit access.On Linux, apply:`chmod 750 /etc/sensitive.conf``chown root:admin /etc/sensitive.conf`File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):- Use tools like Tripwire, Wazuh, or OSSEC to monitor changes to critical file permissions.Audit File System Access:- Enable auditing to track permission changes or unauthorized access attempts.- Use auditd (Linux) or Event Viewer (Windows) to log activities.Restrict Startup Directories:- Configure permissions to prevent unauthorized writes to directories like `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu`.Example: Restrict write access to critical directories like `/etc/`, `/usr/local/`, and Windows directories such as `C:\Windows\System32`.- On Windows, use icacls to modify permissions: `icacls "C:\Windows\System32" /inheritance:r /grant:r SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F`- On Linux, monitor permissions using tools like `lsattr` or `auditd`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1022 |
| M1024  | Restrict Registry Permissions                           | Restricting registry permissions involves configuring access control settings for sensitive registry keys and hives to ensure that only authorized users or processes can make modifications. By limiting access, organizations can prevent unauthorized changes that adversaries might use for persistence, privilege escalation, or defense evasion. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Review and Adjust Permissions on Critical Keys- Regularly review permissions on keys such as `Run`, `RunOnce`, and `Services` to ensure only authorized users have write access.- Use tools like `icacls` or `PowerShell` to automate permission adjustments.Enable Registry Auditing- Enable auditing on sensitive keys to log access attempts.- Use Event Viewer or SIEM solutions to analyze logs and detect suspicious activity.- Example Audit Policy: `auditpol /set /subcategory:"Registry" /success:enable /failure:enable`Protect Credential-Related Hives- Limit access to hives like `SAM`,`SECURITY`, and `SYSTEM` to prevent credential dumping or other unauthorized access.- Use LSA Protection to add an additional security layer for credential storage.Restrict Registry Editor Usage- Use Group Policy to restrict access to regedit.exe for non-administrative users.- Block execution of registry editing tools on endpoints where they are unnecessary.Deploy Baseline Configuration Tools- Use tools like Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit or CIS Benchmarks to apply and maintain secure registry configurations.*Tools for Implementation* Registry Permission Tools:- Registry Editor (regedit): Built-in tool to manage registry permissions.- PowerShell: Automate permissions and manage keys. `Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "KeyName" -Value "Value"`- icacls: Command-line tool to modify ACLs.Monitoring Tools:- Sysmon: Monitor and log registry events.- Event Viewer: View registry access logs.Policy Management Tools:- Group Policy Management Console (GPMC): Enforce registry permissions via GPOs.- Microsoft Endpoint Manager: Deploy configuration baselines for registry permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1024 |
| M1025  | Privileged Process Integrity                            | Privileged Process Integrity focuses on defending highly privileged processes (e.g., system services, antivirus, or authentication processes) from tampering, injection, or compromise by adversaries.

This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Centralized Log Management:- Configure endpoints to forward security logs to a centralized log collector or SIEM.- Use tools like Splunk Graylog, or Security Onion to aggregate and store logs.- Example command (Linux): `sudo auditd  \|  tee /var/log/audit/audit.log  \|  nc <remote-log-server> 514`Remote File Storage Solutions:- Utilize cloud storage solutions like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage for sensitive data.- Ensure proper encryption at rest and access control policies (IAM roles, ACLs).Intrusion Detection Log Forwarding:- Forward logs from IDS/IPS systems (e.g., Zeek/Suricata) to a remote security information system.- Example for Suricata log forwarding:`outputs:  - type: syslog    protocol: tls    address: <remote-syslog-server>`Immutable Backup Configurations:- Enable immutable storage settings for backups to prevent adversaries from modifying or deleting data.- Example: AWS S3 Object Lock.Data Encryption:- Ensure encryption for sensitive data using AES-256 at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.Tools: OpenSSL, BitLocker, LUKS for Linux.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1029 |
| M1030  | Network Segmentation                                    | Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments to control and limit the flow of traffic between devices, systems, and applications. By segmenting networks, organizations can reduce the attack surface, restrict lateral movement by adversaries, and protect critical assets from compromise.Effective network segmentation leverages a combination of physical boundaries, logical separation through VLANs, and access control policies enforced by network appliances like firewalls, routers, and cloud-based configurations. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Segment Critical Systems:- Identify and group systems based on their function, sensitivity, and risk. Examples include payment systems, HR databases, production systems, and internet-facing servers.- Use VLANs, firewalls, or routers to enforce logical separation.Implement DMZ for Public-Facing Services:- Host web servers, DNS servers, and email servers in a DMZ to limit their access to internal systems.- Apply strict firewall rules to filter traffic between the DMZ and internal networks.Use Cloud-Based Segmentation:- In cloud environments, use VPCs, subnets, and security groups to isolate applications and enforce traffic rules.- Apply AWS Transit Gateway or Azure VNet peering for controlled connectivity between cloud segments.Apply Microsegmentation for Workloads:- Use software-defined networking (SDN) tools to implement workload-level segmentation and prevent lateral movement.Restrict Traffic with ACLs and Firewalls:- Apply Access Control Lists (ACLs) to network devices to enforce "deny by default" policies.- Use firewalls to restrict both north-south (external-internal) and east-west (internal-internal) traffic.Monitor and Audit Segmented Networks:- Regularly review firewall rules, ACLs, and segmentation policies.- Monitor network flows for anomalies to ensure segmentation is effective.Test Segmentation Effectiveness:- Perform periodic penetration tests to verify that unauthorized access is blocked between network segments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1030 |

| M1032  | Multi-factor Authentication                             | Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring users to provide at least two forms of verification to prove their identity before granting access. These factors typically include:- *Something you know*: Passwords, PINs.- *Something you have*: Physical tokens, smartphone authenticator apps.- *Something you are*: Biometric data such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or retinal scans.Implementing MFA across all critical systems and services ensures robust protection against account takeover and unauthorized access. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Identity and Access Management (IAM):- Use IAM solutions like Azure Active Directory, Okta, or AWS IAM to enforce MFA policies for all user logins, especially for privileged roles.- Enable conditional access policies to enforce MFA for risky sign-ins (e.g., unfamiliar devices, geolocations).Authentication Tools and Methods:- Use authenticator applications such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy for time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).- Deploy hardware-based tokens like YubiKey, RSA SecurID, or smart cards for additional security.- Enforce biometric authentication for compatible devices and applications.Secure Legacy Systems:- Integrate MFA solutions with older systems using third-party tools like Duo Security or Thales SafeNet.- Enable RADIUS/NPS servers to facilitate MFA for VPNs, RDP, and other network logins.Monitoring and Alerting:- Use SIEM tools to monitor failed MFA attempts, login anomalies, or brute-force attempts against MFA systems.- Implement alerts for suspicious MFA activities, such as repeated failed codes or new device registrations.Training and Policy Enforcement:- Educate employees on the importance of MFA and secure authenticator usage.- Enforce policies that require MFA on all critical systems, especially for remote access, privileged accounts, and cloud applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1032 |

This can include employing technologies like network concentrators, RDP gateways, and zero-trust network access (ZTNA) models, alongside hardening services and protocols. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Audit and Restrict Access:- Regularly audit permissions for file shares, network services, and remote access tools.- Remove unnecessary access and enforce least privilege principles for users and services.- Use Active Directory and IAM tools to restrict access based on roles and attributes.Deploy Secure Remote Access Solutions:- Use RDP gateways, VPN concentrators, and ZTNA solutions to aggregate and secure remote access connections.- Configure access controls to restrict connections based on time, device, and user identity.- Enforce MFA for all remote access mechanisms.Disable Unnecessary Services:- Identify running services using tools like netstat (Windows/Linux) or Nmap.- Disable unused services, such as Telnet, FTP, and legacy SMB, to reduce the attack surface.- Use firewall rules to block traffic on unused ports and protocols.Network Segmentation and Isolation:- Use VLANs, firewalls, or micro-segmentation to isolate critical network resources from general access.- Restrict communication between subnets to prevent lateral movement.Monitor and Log Access:- Monitor access attempts to file shares, RDP, and remote network resources using SIEM tools.- Enable auditing and logging for successful and failed attempts to access restricted resources.*Tools for Implementation*File Share Management:- Microsoft Active Directory Group Policies- Samba (Linux/Unix file share management)- AccessEnum (Windows access auditing tool)Secure Remote Access:- Microsoft Remote Desktop Gateway- Apache Guacamole (open-source RDP/VNC gateway)- Zero Trust solutions: Tailscale, Cloudflare Zero TrustService and Protocol Hardening:- Nmap or Nessus for network service discovery- Windows Group Policy Editor for disabling SMBv1, Telnet, and legacy protocols- iptables or firewalld (Linux) for blocking unnecessary trafficNetwork Segmentation:- pfSense for open-source network isolation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1035 |
| M1036  | Account Use Policies                                    | Account Use Policies help mitigate unauthorized access by configuring and enforcing rules that govern how and when accounts can be used. These policies include enforcing account lockout mechanisms, restricting login times, and setting inactivity timeouts. Proper configuration of these policies reduces the risk of brute-force attacks, credential theft, and unauthorized access by limiting the opportunities for malicious actors to exploit accounts. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Account Lockout Policies:- Implementation: Configure account lockout settings so that after a defined number of failed login attempts (e.g., 3-5 attempts), the account is locked for a specific time period (e.g., 15 minutes) or requires an administrator to unlock it.- Use Case: This prevents brute-force attacks by limiting how many incorrect password attempts can be made before the account is temporarily disabled, reducing the likelihood of an attacker successfully guessing a password.Login Time Restrictions:- Implementation: Set up login time policies to restrict when users or groups can log into systems. For example, only allowing login during standard business hours (e.g., 8 AM to 6 PM) for non-administrative accounts.- Use Case: This prevents unauthorized access outside of approved working hours, where login attempts might be more suspicious or harder to monitor. For example, if an account that is only supposed to be active during the day logs in at 2 AM, it should raise an alert or be blocked.Inactivity Timeout and Session Termination:- Implementation: Enforce session timeouts after a period of inactivity (e.g., 10-15 minutes) and require users to re-authenticate if they wish to resume the session.- Use Case: This policy prevents attackers from hijacking active sessions left unattended. For example, if an employee walks away from their computer without locking it, an attacker with physical access to the system would be unable to exploit the session.Password Aging Policies:- Implementation: Enforce password aging rules, requiring users to change their passwords after a defined period (e.g., 90 days) and ensure passwords are not reused by maintaining a password history.- Use Case: This limits the risk of compromised passwords being used indefinitely. Regular password changes make it more difficult for attackers to reuse stolen credentials.Account Expiration and Deactivation:- Implementation: Configure user accounts, especially for temporary or contract workers, to automatically expire after a set date or event. Accounts that remain unused for a specific period should be deactivated automatically.- Use Case: This prevents dormant accounts from becoming an attack vector. For example, an attacker can exploit unused accounts if they are not properly monitored or deactivated.**Tools for Implementation**:- Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in Windows: To enforce account lockout thresholds, login time restrictions, session timeouts, and password policies.- Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions: For centralized management of user accounts, session policies, and automated deactivation of accounts.- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms: To monitor and alert on unusual login activity, such as failed logins or out-of-hours access attempts.- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Tools: To further enforce secure login attempts, preventing brute-force or credential stuffing attacks. | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1036 |

This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Ingress Traffic Filtering:- Use Case: Configure network firewalls to allow traffic only from authorized IP addresses to public-facing servers.- Implementation: Limit SSH (port 22) and RDP (port 3389) traffic to specific IP ranges.Egress Traffic Filtering:- Use Case: Use firewalls or endpoint security software to block unauthorized outbound traffic to prevent data exfiltration and command-and-control (C2) communications.- Implementation: Block outbound traffic to known malicious IPs or regions where communication is unexpected.Protocol-Based Filtering:- Use Case: Restrict the use of specific protocols that are commonly abused by adversaries, such as SMB, RPC, or Telnet, based on business needs.- Implementation: Disable SMBv1 on endpoints to prevent exploits like EternalBlue.Network Segmentation:- Use Case: Create network segments for critical systems and restrict communication between segments unless explicitly authorized.- Implementation: Implement VLANs to isolate IoT devices or guest networks from core business systems.Application Layer Filtering:- Use Case: Use proxy servers or Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to inspect and block malicious HTTP/S traffic.- Implementation: Configure a WAF to block SQL injection attempts or other web application exploitation techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1037 |
| M1038  | Execution Prevention                                    | Prevent the execution of unauthorized or malicious code on systems by implementing application control, script blocking, and other execution prevention mechanisms. This ensures that only trusted and authorized code is executed, reducing the risk of malware and unauthorized actions. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Application Control:- Use Case: Use tools like AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) to create whitelists of authorized applications and block unauthorized ones. On Linux, use tools like SELinux or AppArmor to define mandatory access control policies for application execution.- Implementation: Allow only digitally signed or pre-approved applications to execute on servers and endpoints. (e.g., `New-AppLockerPolicy -PolicyType Enforced -FilePath "C:\Policies\AppLocker.xml"`) Script Blocking:- Use Case: Use script control mechanisms to block unauthorized execution of scripts, such as PowerShell or JavaScript. Web Browsers: Use browser extensions or settings to block JavaScript execution from untrusted sources.- Implementation: Configure PowerShell to enforce Constrained Language Mode for non-administrator users. (e.g., `Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned`) Executable Blocking:- Use Case: Prevent execution of binaries from suspicious locations, such as `%TEMP%` or `%APPDATA%` directories.- Implementation: Block execution of `.exe`, `.bat`, or `.ps1` files from user-writable directories.Dynamic Analysis Prevention:- Use Case: Use behavior-based execution prevention tools to identify and block malicious activity in real time.- Implemenation: Employ EDR solutions that analyze runtime behavior and block suspicious code execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1038 |
| M1039  | Environment Variable Permissions                        | Restrict the modification of environment variables to authorized users and processes by enforcing strict permissions and policies. This ensures the integrity of environment variables, preventing adversaries from abusing or altering them for malicious purposes. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Restrict Write Access:- Use Case: Set file system-level permissions to restrict access to environment variable configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, `systemd` service files).- Implementation: Configure `/etc/environment` or `/etc/profile` on Linux systems to only allow root or administrators to modify the file.Secure Access Controls:- Use Case: Limit access to environment variable settings in application deployment tools or CI/CD pipelines to authorized personnel.- Implementation: Use role-based access control (RBAC) in tools like Jenkins or GitLab to ensure only specific users can modify environment variables.Restrict Process Scope:- Use Case: Configure policies to ensure environment variables are only accessible to the processes they are explicitly intended for.- Implementation: Use containerized environments like Docker to isolate environment variables to specific containers and ensure they are not inherited by other processes.Audit Environment Variable Changes:- Use Case: Enable logging for changes to critical environment variables.- Implementation: Use `auditd` on Linux to monitor changes to files like `/etc/environment` or application-specific environment files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1039 |
| M1040  | Behavior Prevention on Endpoint                         | Behavior Prevention on Endpoint refers to the use of technologies and strategies to detect and block potentially malicious activities by analyzing the behavior of processes, files, API calls, and other endpoint events. Rather than relying solely on known signatures, this approach leverages heuristics, machine learning, and real-time monitoring to identify anomalous patterns indicative of an attack. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Suspicious Process Behavior:- Implementation: Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to monitor and block processes exhibiting unusual behavior, such as privilege escalation attempts.- Use Case: An attacker uses a known vulnerability to spawn a privileged process from a user-level application. The endpoint tool detects the abnormal parent-child process relationship and blocks the action.Unauthorized File Access:- Implementation: Leverage Data Loss Prevention (DLP) or endpoint tools to block processes attempting to access sensitive files without proper authorization.- Use Case: A process tries to read or modify a sensitive file located in a restricted directory, such as /etc/shadow on Linux or the SAM registry hive on Windows. The endpoint tool identifies this anomalous behavior and prevents it.Abnormal API Calls:- Implementation: Implement runtime analysis tools to monitor API calls and block those associated with malicious activities.- Use Case: A process dynamically injects itself into another process to hijack its execution. The endpoint detects the abnormal use of APIs like `OpenProcess` and `WriteProcessMemory` and terminates the offending process.Exploit Prevention:- Implementation: Use behavioral exploit prevention tools to detect and block exploits attempting to gain unauthorized access.- Use Case: A buffer overflow exploit is launched against a vulnerable application.

| M1045  | Code Signing                                            | Code Signing is a security process that ensures the authenticity and integrity of software by digitally signing executables, scripts, and other code artifacts. It prevents untrusted or malicious code from executing by verifying the digital signatures against trusted sources. Code signing protects against tampering, impersonation, and distribution of unauthorized or malicious software, forming a critical defense against supply chain and software exploitation attacks. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Enforce Signed Code Execution:- Implementation: Configure operating systems (e.g., Windows with AppLocker or Linux with Secure Boot) to allow only signed code to execute.- Use Case: Prevent the execution of malicious PowerShell scripts by requiring all scripts to be signed with a trusted certificate.Vendor-Signed Driver Enforcement:- Implementation: Enable kernel-mode code signing to ensure that only drivers signed by trusted vendors can be loaded.- Use Case: A malicious driver attempting to modify system memory fails to load because it lacks a valid signature.Certificate Revocation Management:- Implementation: Use Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) or Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) to block certificates associated with compromised or deprecated code.- Use Case: A compromised certificate used to sign a malicious update is revoked, preventing further execution of the software.Third-Party Software Verification:- Implementation: Require software from external vendors to be signed with valid certificates before deployment.- Use Case: An organization only deploys signed and verified third-party software to prevent supply chain attacks.Script Integrity in CI/CD Pipelines:- Implementation: Integrate code signing into CI/CD pipelines to sign and verify code artifacts before production release.- Use Case: A software company ensures that all production builds are signed, preventing tampered builds from reaching customers.**Key Components of Code Signing**- Digital Signature Verification: Verifies the authenticity of code by ensuring it was signed by a trusted entity.- Certificate Management: Uses Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to manage signing certificates and revocation lists.- Enforced Policy for Unsigned Code: Prevents the execution of unsigned or untrusted binaries and scripts.- Hash Integrity Check: Confirms that code has not been altered since signing by comparing cryptographic hashes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1045 |
| M1046  | Boot Integrity                                          | Boot Integrity ensures that a system starts securely by verifying the integrity of its boot process, operating system, and associated components. This mitigation focuses on leveraging secure boot mechanisms, hardware-rooted trust, and runtime integrity checks to prevent tampering during the boot sequence. It is designed to thwart adversaries attempting to modify system firmware, bootloaders, or critical OS components. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Implementation of Secure Boot:- Implementation: Enable UEFI Secure Boot on all systems and configure it to allow only signed bootloaders and operating systems.- Use Case: An adversary attempts to replace the systemâ€™s bootloader with a malicious version to gain persistence. Secure Boot prevents the untrusted bootloader from executing, halting the attack.Utilization of TPMs:- Implementation: Configure systems to use TPM-based attestation for boot integrity, ensuring that any modification to the firmware, bootloader, or OS is detected.- Use Case: A compromised firmware component alters the boot sequence. The TPM detects the change and triggers an alert, allowing the organization to respond before further damage.Enable Bootloader Passwords:- Implementation: Protect BIOS/UEFI settings with a strong password and limit physical access to devices.- Use Case: An attacker with physical access attempts to disable Secure Boot or modify the boot sequence. The password prevents unauthorized changes.Runtime Integrity Monitoring:- Implementation: Deploy solutions to verify the integrity of critical files and processes after boot.- Use Case: A malware infection modifies kernel modules post-boot. Runtime integrity monitoring detects the modification and prevents the malicious module from loading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1046 |

It is considered more critical for regulated industries such as, healthcare, finance and government where compliance requirements demand stringent tracking of user and system activates.This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: System Audit:- Use Case: Regularly assess system configurations to ensure compliance with organizational security policies.- Implementation: Use tools to scan for deviations from established benchmarks.Permission Audits:- Use Case: Review file and folder permissions to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.- Implementation: Run access reviews to identify users or groups with excessive permissions.Software Audits:- Use Case: Identify outdated, unsupported, or insecure software that could serve as an attack vector.- Implementation: Use inventory and vulnerability scanning tools to detect outdated versions and recommend secure alternatives.Configuration Audits:- Use Case: Evaluate system and network configurations to ensure secure settings (e.g., disabled SMBv1, enabled MFA).- Implementation: Implement automated configuration scanning tools like SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) to identify non-compliant systems.Network Audits:- Use Case: Examine network traffic, firewall rules, and endpoint communications to identify unauthorized or insecure connections.- Implementation: Utilize tools such as Wireshark, or Zeek to monitor and log suspicious network behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1047 |
| M1048  | Application Isolation and Sandboxing                    | Application Isolation and Sandboxing refers to the technique of restricting the execution of code to a controlled and isolated environment (e.g., a virtual environment, container, or sandbox). This method prevents potentially malicious code from affecting the rest of the system or network by limiting access to sensitive resources and critical operations. The goal is to contain threats and minimize their impact. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Browser Sandboxing:- Use Case: Implement browser sandboxing to isolate untrusted web content, preventing malicious web pages or scripts from accessing sensitive system files.- Implementation: Use tools like Google Chrome's built-in sandbox or deploy solutions like Bromium to secure user web interactions.Application Virtualization:- Use Case: Deploy critical or high-risk applications in a virtualized environment to ensure any compromise does not affect the host system.- Implementation: Use application virtualization platforms to run applications in isolated environments.Email Attachment Sandboxing:- Use Case: Route email attachments to a sandbox environment to detect and block malware before delivering emails to end-users.- Implementation: Integrate security solutions with sandbox capabilities to analyze email attachments.Endpoint Sandboxing:- Use Case: Run all downloaded files and applications in a restricted environment to monitor their behavior for malicious activity.- Implementation: Use endpoint protection tools for sandboxing at the endpoint level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1048 |
| M1049  | Antivirus/Antimalware                                   | Antivirus/Antimalware solutions utilize signatures, heuristics, and behavioral analysis to detect, block, and remediate malicious software, including viruses, trojans, ransomware, and spyware. These solutions continuously monitor endpoints and systems for known malicious patterns and suspicious behaviors that indicate compromise. Antivirus/Antimalware software should be deployed across all devices, with automated updates to ensure protection against the latest threats. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Signature-Based Detection:- Implementation: Use predefined signatures to identify known malware based on unique patterns such as file hashes, byte sequences, or command-line arguments. This method is effective against known threats.- Use Case: When malware like "Emotet" is detected, its signature (such as a specific file hash) matches a known database of malicious software, triggering an alert and allowing immediate quarantine of the infected file.Heuristic-Based Detection:- Implementation: Deploy heuristic algorithms that analyze behavior and characteristics of files and processes to identify potential malware, even if it doesnâ€™t match a known signature.- Use Case: If a program attempts to modify multiple critical system files or initiate suspicious network communications, heuristic analysis may flag it as potentially malicious, even if no specific malware signature is available.Behavioral Detection (Behavior Prevention):- Implementation: Use behavioral analysis to detect patterns of abnormal activities, such as unusual system calls, unauthorized file encryption, or attempts to escalate privileges.- Use Case: Behavioral analysis can detect ransomware attacks early by identifying behavior like mass file encryption, even before a specific ransomware signature has been identified.Real-Time Scanning:- Implementation: Enable real-time scanning to automatically inspect files and network traffic for signs of malware as they are accessed, downloaded, or executed.- Use Case: When a user downloads an email attachment, the antivirus solution scans the file in real-time, checking it against both signatures and heuristics to detect any malicious content before it can be opened.Cloud-Assisted Threat Intelligence:- Implementation: Use cloud-based threat intelligence to ensure the antivirus solution can access the latest malware definitions and real-time threat feeds from a global database of emerging threats.- Use Case: Cloud-assisted antivirus solutions quickly identify newly discovered malware by cross-referencing against global threat databases, providing real-time protection against zero-day attacks.**Tools for Implementation**:- Endpoint Security Platforms: Use solutions such as EDR for comprehensive antivirus/antimalware protection across all systems.- Centralized Management: Implement centralized antivirus management consoles that provide visibility into threat activity, enable policy enforcement, and automate updates.- Behavioral Analysis Tools: Leverage solutions with advanced behavioral analysis capabilities to detect malicious activity patterns that donâ€™t rely on known signatures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1049 |

| M1052  | User Account Control                                    | User Account Control (UAC) is a security feature in Microsoft Windows that prevents unauthorized changes to the operating system. UAC prompts users to confirm or provide administrator credentials when an action requires elevated privileges. Proper configuration of UAC reduces the risk of privilege escalation attacks. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Enable UAC Globally:- Ensure UAC is enabled through Group Policy by setting `User Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode` to `Enabled`.Require Credential Prompt:- Use Group Policy to configure UAC to prompt for administrative credentials instead of just confirmation (`User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt`).Restrict Built-in Administrator Account:Set `Admin Approval Mode` for the built-in Administrator account to `Enabled` in Group Policy.Secure the UAC Prompt:- Configure UAC prompts to display on the secure desktop (`User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation`).Prevent UAC Bypass:- Block untrusted applications from triggering UAC prompts by configuring `User Account Control: Only elevate executables that are signed and validated`.- Use EDR tools to detect and block known UAC bypass techniques.Monitor UAC-Related Events:- Use Windows Event Viewer to monitor for event ID 4688 (process creation) and look for suspicious processes attempting to invoke UAC elevation.*Tools for Implementation*Built-in Windows Tools:- Group Policy Editor: Configure UAC settings centrally for enterprise environments.- Registry Editor: Modify UAC-related settings directly, such as `EnableLUA` and `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin`.Endpoint Security Solutions:- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint: Detects and blocks UAC bypass techniques.- Sysmon: Logs process creations and monitors UAC elevation attempts for suspicious activity.Third-Party Security Tools:- Process Monitor (Sysinternals): Tracks real-time processes interacting with UAC.- EventSentry: Monitors Windows Event Logs for UAC-related alerts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1052 |
| M1053  | Data Backup                                             | Data Backup involves taking and securely storing backups of data from end-user systems and critical servers. It ensures that data remains available in the event of system compromise, ransomware attacks, or other disruptions. Backup processes should include hardening backup systems, implementing secure storage solutions, and keeping backups isolated from the corporate network to prevent compromise during active incidents. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Regular Backup Scheduling:- Use Case: Ensure timely and consistent backups of critical data.- Implementation: Schedule daily incremental backups and weekly full backups for all critical servers and systems.Immutable Backups:- Use Case: Protect backups from modification or deletion, even by attackers.- Implementation: Use write-once-read-many (WORM) storage for backups, preventing ransomware from encrypting or deleting backup files.Backup Encryption:- Use Case: Protect data integrity and confidentiality during transit and storage.- Implementation: Encrypt backups using strong encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256) before storing them in local, cloud, or remote locations.Offsite Backup Storage:- Use Case: Ensure data availability during physical disasters or onsite breaches.- Implementation: Use cloud-based solutions like AWS S3, Azure Backup, or physical offsite storage to maintain a copy of critical data.Backup Testing:- Use Case: Validate backup integrity and ensure recoverability.- Implementation: Regularly test data restoration processes to ensure that backups are not corrupted and can be recovered quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1053 |
| M1054  | Software Configuration                                  | Software configuration refers to making security-focused adjustments to the settings of applications, middleware, databases, or other software to mitigate potential threats. These changes help reduce the attack surface, enforce best practices, and protect sensitive data. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Conduct a Security Review of Application Settings:- Review the software documentation to identify recommended security configurations.- Compare default settings against organizational policies and compliance requirements.Implement Access Controls and Permissions:- Restrict access to sensitive features or data within the software.- Enforce least privilege principles for all roles and accounts interacting with the software.Enable Logging and Monitoring:- Configure detailed logging for key application events such as authentication failures, configuration changes, or unusual activity.- Integrate logs with a centralized monitoring solution, such as a SIEM.Update and Patch Software Regularly:- Ensure the software is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.- Use automated patch management tools to streamline the update process.Disable Unnecessary Features or Services:- Turn off unused functionality or components that could introduce vulnerabilities, such as debugging interfaces or deprecated APIs.Test Configuration Changes:- Perform configuration changes in a staging environment before applying them in production.- Conduct regular audits to ensure that settings remain aligned with security policies.*Tools for Implementation*Configuration Management Tools:- Ansible: Automates configuration changes across multiple applications and environments.- Chef: Ensures consistent application settings through code-based configuration management.- Puppet: Automates software configurations and audits changes for compliance.Security Benchmarking Tools:- CIS-CAT: Provides benchmarks and audits for secure software configurations.- Aqua Security Trivy: Scans containerized applications for configuration issues.Vulnerability Management Solutions:- Nessus: Identifies misconfigurations and suggests corrective actions.Logging and Monitoring Tools:- Splunk: Aggregates and analyzes application logs to detect suspicious activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1054 |
| M1055  | Do Not Mitigate                                         | The Do Not Mitigate category highlights scenarios where attempting to mitigate a specific technique may inadvertently increase the organization's security risk or operational instability. This could happen due to the complexity of the system, the integration of critical processes, or the potential for introducing new vulnerabilities. Instead of direct mitigation, these situations may call for alternative strategies such as detection, monitoring, or response. The Do Not Mitigate category underscores the importance of assessing the trade-offs between mitigation efforts and overall system integrity. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Complex Systems Where Mitigation is Risky:- Interpretation: In certain systems, direct mitigation could introduce new risks, especially if the system is highly interconnected or complex, such as in legacy industrial control systems (ICS). Patching or modifying these systems could result in unplanned downtime, disruptions, or even safety risks.- Use Case: In a power grid control system, attempting to patch or disable certain services related to device communications might disrupt critical operations, leading to unintended service outages.Risk of Reducing Security Coverage:- Interpretation: In some cases, mitigating a technique might reduce the visibility or effectiveness of other security controls, limiting an organizationâ€™s ability to detect broader attacks.- Use Case: Disabling script execution on a web server to mitigate potential PowerShell-based attacks could interfere with legitimate administrative operations that rely on scripting, while attackers may still find alternate ways to execute code.Introduction of New Vulnerabilities:- Interpretation: In highly sensitive or tightly controlled environments, implementing certain mitigations might create vulnerabilities in other parts of the system. For instance, disabling default security mechanisms in an attempt to resolve compatibility issues may open the system to exploitation.- Use Case: Disabling certificate validation to resolve internal communication issues in a secure environment could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, creating a greater vulnerability than the original problem.Negative Impact on Performance and Availability:- Interpretation: Mitigations that involve removing or restricting system functionalities can have unintended consequences for system performance and availability. Some mitigations, while effective at blocking certain attacks, may introduce performance bottlenecks or compromise essential operations.- Use Case: Implementing high levels of encryption to mitigate data theft might result in significant performance degradation in systems handling large volumes of real-time transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1055 |
| M1056  | Pre-compromise                                          | Pre-compromise mitigations involve proactive measures and defenses implemented to prevent adversaries from successfully identifying and exploiting weaknesses during the Reconnaissance and Resource Development phases of an attack. These activities focus on reducing an organization's attack surface, identify adversarial preparation efforts, and increase the difficulty for attackers to conduct successful operations. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Limit Information Exposure:- Regularly audit and sanitize publicly available data, including job posts, websites, and social media.- Use tools like OSINT monitoring platforms (e.g., SpiderFoot, Recon-ng) to identify leaked information.Protect Domain and DNS Infrastructure:- Enable DNSSEC and use WHOIS privacy protection.- Monitor for domain hijacking or lookalike domains using services like RiskIQ or DomainTools.External Monitoring:- Use tools like Shodan, Censys to monitor your external attack surface.- Deploy external vulnerability scanners to proactively address weaknesses.Threat Intelligence:- Leverage platforms like MISP, Recorded Future, or Anomali to track adversarial infrastructure, tools, and activity.Content and Email Protections:- Use email security solutions like Proofpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, or Mimecast.- Enforce SPF/DKIM/DMARC policies to protect against email spoofing.Training and Awareness:- Educate employees on identifying phishing attempts, securing their social media, and avoiding information leaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056 |
| M1057  | Data Loss Prevention                                    | Data Loss Prevention (DLP) involves implementing strategies and technologies to identify, categorize, monitor, and control the movement of sensitive data within an organization. This includes protecting data formats indicative of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), intellectual property, or financial data from unauthorized access, transmission, or exfiltration. DLP solutions integrate with network, endpoint, and cloud platforms to enforce security policies and prevent accidental or malicious data leaks. (Citation: PurpleSec Data Loss Prevention) This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:Sensitive Data Categorization:- Use Case: Identify and classify data based on sensitivity (e.g., PII, financial data, trade secrets).- Implementation: Use DLP solutions to scan and tag files containing sensitive information using predefined patterns, such as Social Security Numbers or credit card details.Exfiltration Restrictions:- Use Case: Prevent unauthorized transmission of sensitive data.- Implementation: Enforce policies to block unapproved email attachments, unauthorized USB usage, or unencrypted data uploads to cloud storage.Data-in-Transit Monitoring:- Use Case: Detect and prevent the transmission of sensitive data over unapproved channels.- Implementation: Deploy network-based DLP tools to inspect outbound traffic for sensitive content (e.g., financial records or PII) and block unapproved transmissions.Endpoint Data Protection:- Use Case: Monitor and control sensitive data usage on endpoints.- Implementation: Use endpoint-based DLP agents to block copy-paste actions of sensitive data and unauthorized printing or file sharing.Cloud Data Security:- Use Case: Protect data stored in cloud platforms.- Implementation: Integrate DLP with cloud storage platforms like Google Drive, OneDrive, or AWS to monitor and restrict sensitive data sharing or downloads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1057 |

| M1060  | Out-of-Band Communications Channel                      | Establish secure out-of-band communication channels to ensure the continuity of critical communications during security incidents, data integrity attacks, or in-network communication failures. Out-of-band communication refers to using an alternative, separate communication path that is not dependent on the potentially compromised primary network infrastructure. This method can include secure messaging apps, encrypted phone lines, satellite communications, or dedicated emergency communication systems. Leveraging these alternative channels reduces the risk of adversaries intercepting, disrupting, or tampering with sensitive communications and helps coordinate an effective incident response.(Citation: TrustedSec OOB Communications)(Citation: NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1060 |
