| DS0001 | Firmware Modification                | Changes made to firmware, which may include its settings, configurations, or underlying data. This can encompass alterations to the Master Boot Record (MBR), Volume Boot Record (VBR), or other firmware components critical to system boot and functionality. Such modifications are often indicators of adversary activity, including malware persistence and system compromise. Examples: - Changes to Master Boot Record (MBR): Modifying the MBR to load malicious code during the boot process.- Changes to Volume Boot Record (VBR): Altering the VBR to redirect boot processes to malicious locations.- Firmware Configuration Changes: Modifying BIOS/UEFI settings such as disabling Secure Boot.- Firmware Image Tampering: Updating firmware with a malicious or unauthorized image.- Logs or Errors Indicating Firmware Changes: Logs showing unauthorized firmware updates or checksum mismatches.This data component can be collected through the following measures:- BIOS/UEFI Logs: Enable and monitor BIOS/UEFI logs to capture settings changes or firmware updates.- Firmware Integrity Monitoring: Use tools or firmware security features to detect changes to firmware components.- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions: Many EDR platforms can detect abnormal firmware activity, such as changes to MBR/VBR or unauthorized firmware updates.- File System Monitoring: Monitor changes to MBR/VBR-related files using tools like Sysmon or auditd.    - Windows Example (Sysmon): Monitor Event ID 7 (Raw disk access).    - Linux Example (auditd): `auditctl -w /dev/sda -p wa -k firmware_modification`- Network Traffic Analysis: Capture firmware updates downloaded over the network, particularly from untrusted sources. Use network monitoring tools like Zeek or Wireshark to analyze firmware-related traffic.- Secure Boot Logs: Collect and analyze Secure Boot logs for signs of tampering or unauthorized configurations. Example: Use PowerShell to retrieve Secure Boot settings on Windows: `Confirm-SecureBootUEFI`- Vendor-Specific Firmware Tools: Many hardware vendors provide tools for firmware integrity checks.Examples:    - Intel Platform Firmware Resilience (PFR).    - Lenovo UEFI diagnostics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0001 |

| DS0004 | Malware Content                      | Code, strings, signatures, and other identifying characteristics of a malicious payload stored within a malware repository. It includes both static (file-based) and dynamic (behavioral or execution-based) components that can be analyzed for threat intelligence, detection, and prevention purposes. Examples:- Static Analysis:    - Executable Code: Analyze binary data to identify unique patterns, obfuscated code, or embedded resources.    - Strings Extraction: Use tools like strings or YARA rules to identify hardcoded URLs, IPs, filenames, or suspicious function calls.    - Signatures: Extract cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA256) of files to track known malware variants or detect previously unseen samples.- Dynamic Analysis:    - Behavioral Observations: Monitor execution traces to capture API calls, registry modifications, or network traffic patterns indicative of malicious behavior.    - Memory Analysis: Examine memory dumps to uncover injected code or runtime-decrypted payloads.    - Artifacts: Record file system changes, process creation events, and command-line arguments.- Threat Intelligence Integration:    - Campaign Attribution: Associate observed code snippets or signatures with known APT campaigns or ransomware families.    - Indicator Sharing: Share identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) with threat intelligence platforms (e.g., MISP, OpenCTI).- Examples of Malware Content:    - Embedded C2 domains (e.g., malicious-domain.com hardcoded in the payload).    - Fileless malware indicators, such as PowerShell scripts invoking Invoke-Mimikatz.    - Malware-specific signatures, such as unique PE header values for a particular strain.*Data Collection Measures:*- Collection from Public Malware Repositories:    - VirusTotal: Obtain samples for static analysis.    - Hybrid Analysis: Gather execution data from sandbox analysis.    - Any.Run: Access interactive malware execution traces.    - MalwareBazaar: Download malware samples for research and signature generation.    - Automate data extraction using repository APIs (e.g., VirusTotal API for hash lookups or sample retrieval).- Internal Malware Labs:    - Sandbox Environments: Use dynamic malware analysis tools such as Cuckoo Sandbox or Joe Sandbox to execute and monitor malware in a controlled environment. Capture runtime behavior logs, memory dumps, and file system changes.    - Reverse Engineering: Disassemble binaries with tools like IDA Pro, Ghidra, or Radare2 to identify malicious functionality and extract code patterns.- EDR/Endpoint Telemetry:    - Collect samples of malicious binaries or scripts from infected endpoints using tools like CrowdStrike, Carbon Black, or SentinelOne.    - Extract memory-resident payloads from live systems for analysis.- Threat Intelligence Platforms:    - Gather contextual metadata for identified malware using tools like OpenCTI, Recorded Future, or ThreatConnect. Participate in intelligence-sharing groups such as ISACs (e.g., FS-ISAC, IT-ISAC).- Custom Data Collection Pipelines: Use open-source tools like malwoverview or Maltrail to automate sample downloads, hash extraction, and IOC generation. | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0004 |

| DS0007 | Image Creation                       | Initial construction of a virtual machine image within a cloud environment. Virtual machine images are templates containing an operating system and installed applications, which can be deployed to create new virtual machines. Monitoring the creation of these images is important because adversaries may create custom images to include malicious software or misconfigurations for later exploitation. Examples: - Azure Compute Service Image Creation    - Example: Creating a virtual machine image in Azure using Azure CLI: `az image create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyImage --source MyVM`- AWS EC2 AMI (Amazon Machine Image) Creation    - Example: Creating an AMI from an EC2 instance: `aws ec2 create-image --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --name "MyAMI" --description "An AMI for my app"`- Google Cloud Compute Engine Image Creation    - Example: Creating a custom image using gcloud: `gcloud compute images create my-custom-image --source-disk my-disk --source-disk-zone us-central1-a`- VMware vSphere    - Example: Exporting a VM to create an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) template: This could later be imported into other environments with potential tampering.This data component can be collected through the following measures:Enable Cloud Platform Logging- Azure: Enable "Activity Logs" to capture image-related events such as PUT requests to `Microsoft.Compute/images`.- AWS: Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor `CreateImage` API calls.- Google Cloud: Enable "Cloud Audit Logs" to track custom image creation events under `compute.googleapis.com/images`.API Monitoring- Monitor API activity to track the creation of new images using:    - AWS SDK/CLI `CreateImage`.    - Azure REST API for image creation.    - Google Cloud Compute Engine APIs.Cloud SIEM Integration- Ingest cloud platform logs into a centralized SIEM for real-time monitoring and alerting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0007 |

| DS0008 | Kernel Module Load                   | The process of loading a kernel module into the operating system kernel. Kernel modules are object files that extend the kernel’s functionality, such as adding support for device drivers, new filesystems, or additional system calls. This action can be legitimate (e.g., loading a driver) or malicious (e.g., adding a rootkit). *Data Collection Measures:*- Linux:    - Auditd: Enable auditing of kernel module loading. Example rule: `-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S init_module,delete_module`.    - Syslog: Monitor `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages` for entries related to kernel module loads.    - Systemd Journal: Use `journalctl` to query logs for module loading events: `journalctl -k  \|  grep "Loading kernel module"`- macOS:    - Unified Logs: Use the `log` command to query kernel module events: `log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "kextload"' --info`    - Endpoint Security Framework (ESF): Monitor for `ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_KEXTLOAD` (kernel extension loading events).- Kernel-Specific Tools:    - Lsmod: Use `lsmod` to list loaded kernel modules in real-time.    - Kprobe/eBPF: Use extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) or Kernel Probes (kprobes) to monitor kernel events, including module loading. Example using eBPF tools like BCC:`sudo python /path/to/bcc/tools/kprobe -v do_init_module`- Enable EDR Monitoring:    - Configure alerts for: Suspicious kernel module loads from non-standard paths (e.g., /tmp). Unexpected or unsigned kernel modules.    - Review detailed telemetry data provided by the EDR for insight into who initiated the module load, the file path, and whether the module was signed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0008 |

ProcMon can provide granular details on API usage and identify malicious behavior during analysis.- Windows Event Logs:    - Use Event IDs from Windows logs for specific API-related activities:        - Event ID 4688: A new process has been created (can indirectly infer API use).        - Event ID 4657: A registry value has been modified (to monitor registry-altering APIs).- Dynamic Analysis Tools:    - Tools like Cuckoo Sandbox, Flare VM, or Hybrid Analysis monitor API execution during malware detonation.- Host-Based Logs:    - On Linux/macOS systems, leverage audit frameworks (e.g., `auditd`, `strace`) to capture and analyze system call usage that APIs map to.- Runtime Monitors:    - Runtime security tools like Falco can monitor system-level calls for API execution.- Debugging and Tracing:    - Use debugging tools like gdb (Linux) or WinDbg (Windows) for deep tracing of API executions in real time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0009 |

| DS0010 | Cloud Storage Creation               | Cloud Storage Creation refers to the initial creation of a new cloud storage resource, such as buckets, containers, or directories, within a cloud environment. This action is critical to track as it might indicate the legitimate provisioning of resources or unauthorized actions taken by adversaries to stage, store, or exfiltrate data. Examples: - AWS S3 Bucket Creation: An AWS user creates a new S3 bucket using the `CreateBucket` API call.- Azure Blob Storage Container Creation: A user creates a new container in Azure Blob Storage using the `Create Container` operation.- Google Cloud Storage Bucket Creation: A Google Cloud user creates a new bucket using `storage.buckets.create`.- OpenStack Swift Container Creation: A user creates a new container in OpenStack Swift using the `PUT` method.This data component can be collected through the following measures:Enable Logging for Cloud Storage Services- AWS S3: Enable AWS CloudTrail to log CreateBucket API actions.- Azure Blob Storage: Enable Azure Monitor and Diagnostic Logs for storage account activity. Use Azure Event Grid to capture Create Container operations.- Google Cloud Storage: Enable Data Access logs in Cloud Audit Logs to monitor storage.buckets.create API calls.- OpenStack Swift: Configure Swift logging to capture PUT requests to new containers.Centralized Logging and Analysis- Forward logs to centralized platforms like Splunk or cloud-native SIEM solutions for correlation and analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0010 |

Pod modifications are often executed using commands like kubectl set, kubectl patch, or kubectl edit.*Data Collection Measures:* - Kubernetes API Server Audit Logs:    - Capture all API calls related to pod modification, such as PATCH, PUT, or UPDATE methods on v1/pods.- Runtime Security Tools:    - Tools like Falco, Sysdig, and Kube-bench can monitor pod modifications at runtime and alert on policy violations.- Container Orchestration Logs:    - Monitor events logged by Kubernetes itself (e.g., `kubectl logs -n kube-system kube-controller-manager`).- SIEM and EDR Solutions:    - Use SIEM platforms (e.g., Splunk) to aggregate API server logs and detect patterns of unauthorized or suspicious pod modifications.    - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools configured with container visibility can monitor commands like `kubectl` set or `kubectl patch`.- Host-Based Monitoring:    - Collect and analyze logs for processes executing `kubectl` commands or interacting with Kubernetes configuration files (e.g., `.kube/config`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0014 |
| DS0014 | Pod Creation                         | The initial deployment or instantiation of a new pod in a containerized environment. This includes creating a pod manually, through orchestration tools (Kubernetes), or via Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configurations. A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, typically containing one or more containers. Creation methods include:- Direct pod deployment (`kubectl run`, `kubectl apply`)- Automated deployment via CI/CD pipelines (e.g., ArgoCD, Jenkins, GitOps)- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates (e.g., Terraform, Helm Charts)- API-based deployments via Kubernetes control plane (create_pod API calls)- Pods can be ephemeral (short-lived) or persistent (part of a StatefulSet or Deployment).*Data Collection Measures:*- Kubernetes Audit Logs    - Captures all API requests, including pod `create` events.- Kube-api server Logs	    - Monitors API calls related to pod deployments and modifications. Related Events: `PodSandboxChanged`, `SyncLoop`, `Created pod`- Container Runtime Logs	    - Logs from CRI-O, containerd, or Docker capture pod creation events. Related Events: `container start`, `container create`- Cloud Provider Logs	    - GKE, EKS, AKS logs provide insights into Kubernetes API interactions.- SIEM & Log Aggregation	    - Integrates Kubernetes logs into SIEM solutions.- EDR/XDR Solutions	    - Monitors container-based activity for anomalous pod creations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0014 |

Examples: - Querying Host-Based Firewalls: Using Windows PowerShell commands like `Get-NetFirewallRule` or Linux commands such as `iptables -L` or `firewalld --list-all`.- Cloud Firewall Rule Listing: Running commands like `az network firewall list` for Azure or `aws ec2 describe-security-groups` for AWS.- Using Management APIs: Leveraging APIs like Google Cloud Firewall's `list` API method or AWS's DescribeSecurityGroups API.Identifying Misconfigurations: Extracting firewall rules to identify “allow all” policies or rules that lack logging.- Enumerating with CLI Tools: Using CLI commands like `gcloud compute firewall-rules list` to extract firewall settings in Google Cloud.This data component can be collected through the following measures:Cloud Control Plane- Azure Activity Logs:Collect logs from Azure Firewall to monitor rule listing commands. Enable logging for `az network firewall` commands.- AWS CloudTrail: Monitor calls to `DescribeSecurityGroups` or `DescribeNetworkAcls` APIs.Google Cloud Operations Suite: Collect logs for `gcloud compute firewall-rules list` or API calls to `firewalls.list`.Host-Based Firewalls- Windows Event Logs: Use PowerShell transcription logs to capture commands like `Get-NetFirewallRule`.- Linux Auditd: Track executions of commands like `iptables -L` or `ufw status` using auditd: `auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -k firewall_enum`- macOS: Monitor logs for firewall-related queries via the Console app or log monitoring tools.SIEM Integration- Collect logs from endpoints and cloud platforms to centralize data and detect enumeration activity.Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)- Use EDR tools to track enumeration commands or API calls performed on managed devices.CSPM Tools- Deploy Cloud Security Posture Management tools to monitor for unauthorized enumeration of firewall rules or configurations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0018 |

| DS0022 | File Metadata                        | contextual information about a file, including attributes such as the file's name, size, type, content (e.g., signatures, headers, media), user/owner, permissions, timestamps, and other related properties. File metadata provides insights into a file's characteristics and can be used to detect malicious activity, unauthorized modifications, or other anomalies. Examples: - File Ownership and Permissions: Checking the owner and permissions of a critical configuration file like /etc/passwd on Linux or C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM on Windows.- Timestamps: Analyzing the creation, modification, and access timestamps of a file.- File Content and Signatures: Extracting the headers of an executable file to verify its signature or detect packing/obfuscation.- File Attributes: Analyzing attributes like hidden, system, or read-only flags in Windows.- File Hashes: Generating MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 hashes of files to compare against threat intelligence feeds.- File Location: Monitoring files located in unusual directories or paths, such as temporary or user folders.This data component can be collected through the following measures:Windows- Sysinternals Tools: Use `AccessEnum` or `PSFile` to retrieve metadata about file access and permissions.- Windows Event Logs: Enable object access auditing and monitor events like 4663 (Object Access) and 5140 (A network share object was accessed).- PowerShell: Use Get-Item or Get-ChildItem cmdlets: `Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Path\To\Directory" -Recurse  \|  Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime, Attributes`Linux- File System Commands: Use `ls -l` or stat to retrieve file metadata: `stat /path/to/file`- Auditd: Configure audit rules to log metadata access: `auditctl -w /path/to/file -p wa -k file_metadata`- Filesystem Integrity Tools: Tools like tripwire or AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) can monitor file metadata changes.macOS- FSEvents: Use FSEvents to track file metadata changes.- Endpoint Security Framework (ESF): Capture metadata-related events via ESF APIs.- Command-Line Tools: Use ls -l or xattr for file attributes: `ls -l@ /path/to/file`SIEM Integration- Forward file metadata logs from endpoint or network devices to a SIEM for centralized analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022 |

Monitoring file deletions helps organizations identify unauthorized or suspicious activities.This data component can be collected through the following measures:Windows- Sysmon: Event ID 23: Logs file deletion events, including details such as file paths and responsible processes.- Windows Event Log: Enable "Object Access" auditing to monitor file deletions.- PowerShell: `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4663}  \|  Where-Object {$_.Message -like '*DELETE*'}`Linux- Auditd: Use audit rules to capture file deletion events: `auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S unlink -S rename -S rmdir -k file_deletion`- Query logs: `ausearch -k file_deletion`- Inotify: Use inotifywait to monitor file deletions: `inotifywait -m /path/to/watch -e delete`macOS- Endpoint Security Framework (ESF): Monitor events like ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_UNLINK to capture file deletion activities.- FSEvents: Track file deletion activities in real-time: `fs_usage  \|  grep unlink`SIEM Integration- Forward file deletion logs to a SIEM for centralized monitoring and correlation with other events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022 |
| DS0022 | File Creation                        | A new file is created on a system or network storage. This action often signifies an operation such as saving a document, writing data, or deploying a file. Logging these events helps identify legitimate or potentially malicious file creation activities. Examples include logging file creation events (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 11 or Linux auditd logs). This data component can be collected through the following measures:Windows- Sysmon: Event ID 11: Logs file creation events, capturing details like the file path, hash, and creation time.- Windows Event Log: Enable "Object Access" auditing in Group Policy to track file creation under Event ID 4663.- PowerShell: Real-time monitoring of file creation:`Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4663}`Linux- Auditd: Use audit rules to monitor file creation: `auditctl -w /path/to/directory -p w -k file_creation`- View logs: `ausearch -k file_creation`- Inotify: Monitor file creation with inotifywait: `inotifywait -m /path/to/watch -e create`macOS- Unified Logs: Use the macOS Unified Logging System to capture file creation events.- FSEvents: Use File System Events to monitor file creation: `fs_usage  \|  grep create`Network Devices- NAS Logs: Monitor file creation events on network-attached storage devices.- SMB Logs: Collect logs of file creation activities over SMB/CIFS protocols.SIEM Integration- Forward logs from all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) to a SIEM for central analysis and alerting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022 |
| DS0022 | File Access                          | To events where a file is opened or accessed, making its contents available to the requester. This includes reading, executing, or interacting with files by authorized or unauthorized entities. Examples include logging file access events (e.g., Windows Event ID 4663), monitoring file reads, and detecting unusual file access patterns. Examples: - File Read Operations: A user opens a sensitive document (e.g., financial_report.xlsx) on a shared drive.- File Execution: A script or executable file is accessed and executed (e.g., malware.exe is run from a temporary directory).- Unauthorized File Access: An unauthorized user attempts to access a protected configuration file (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux or `System32` files on Windows).- File Access Patterns: Bulk access to multiple files in a short time (e.g., mass access to documents on a file server).- File Access via Network: Files on a network share are accessed remotely (e.g., logs of SMB file access).This data component can be collected through the following measures:Windows- Windows Event Logs: Event ID 4663: Captures file system auditing details, including who accessed the file, access type, and file name.- Sysmon:    - Event ID 11: Logs file creation time changes.    - Event ID 1 (process creation): Can provide insight into files executed.- PowerShell: Commands to monitor file access in real-time: `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4663}`Linux- Auditd: Monitor file access events using audit rules: `auditctl -w /path/to/file -p rwxa -k file_access`- View logs: `ausearch -k file_access`- Inotify: Use inotify to track file access on Linux: `inotifywait -m /path/to/watch -e access`macOS- Unified Logs: Monitor file access using the macOS Unified Logging System.- FSEvents: File System Events can track file accesses: `fs_usage  \|  grep open`Network Devices- SMB/CIFS Logs: Monitor file access over network shares using logs from SMB or CIFS protocol.- NAS Logs: Collect logs from network-attached storage systems for file access events.SIEM Integration- Collect file access logs from all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and centralize in a SIEM for correlation and analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022 |

| DS0022 | File Modification                    | Changes made to a file, including updates to its contents, metadata, access permissions, or attributes. These modifications may indicate legitimate activity (e.g., software updates) or unauthorized changes (e.g., tampering, ransomware, or adversarial modifications). Examples: - Content Modifications: Changes to the content of a configuration file, such as modifying `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on Linux or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows.- Permission Changes: Altering file permissions to allow broader access, such as changing a file from `644` to `777` on Linux or modifying NTFS permissions on Windows.- Attribute Modifications: Changing a file's attributes to hidden, read-only, or system on Windows.- Timestamp Manipulation: Adjusting a file's creation or modification timestamp using tools like `touch` in Linux or timestomping tools on Windows.- Software or System File Changes: Modifying system files such as `boot.ini`, kernel modules, or application binaries.This data component can be collected through the following measures:Windows- Event Logs: Enable file system auditing to monitor file modifications using Security Event ID 4670 (File System Audit) or Sysmon Event ID 2 (File creation time changed).- PowerShell: Use Get-ItemProperty or Get-Acl cmdlets to monitor file properties: `Get-Item -Path "C:\path\to\file"  \|  Select-Object Name, Attributes, LastWriteTime`Linux- File System Monitoring: Use tools like auditd with rules to monitor file modifications: `auditctl -w /path/to/file -p wa -k file_modification`- Inotify: Use inotifywait to watch for real-time changes to files or directories: `inotifywait -m /path/to/file`macOS- Endpoint Security Framework (ESF): Monitor file modification events using ESF APIs.- Audit Framework: Configure audit rules to track file changes.- Command-Line Tools: Use fs_usage to monitor file activities: `fs_usage -w /path/to/file`SIEM Tools- Collect logs from endpoint agents (e.g., Sysmon, Auditd) and file servers to centralize file modification event data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022 |

| DS0025 | Cloud Service Modification           | Cloud service modification refers to changes made to the configuration, settings, or data of a cloud service. These modifications can include administrative changes such as enabling or disabling features, altering permissions, or deleting critical components. Monitoring these changes is critical to detect potential misconfigurations or malicious activity. Examples: - AWS Cloud Service Modifications: A user disables AWS CloudTrail logging (StopLogging) or deletes a CloudWatch configuration rule (DeleteConfigRule).- Azure Cloud Service Modifications: Changes to Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles, such as adding a new Contributor role to a sensitive resource.- Google Cloud Service Modifications: Deletion of a Google Cloud Storage bucket or disabling a Google Cloud Function.- Office 365 Cloud Service Modifications: Altering mailbox permissions or disabling auditing in Microsoft 365.This data component can be collected through the following measures:Enable Cloud Audit Logging- AWS: Enable AWS CloudTrail for logging management events such as StopLogging or DeleteTrail.- Azure: Use Azure Activity Logs to monitor resource changes and access actions.- Google Cloud: Enable Google Cloud Audit Logs to track API calls, resource modifications, and policy changes.- Office 365: Use Unified Audit Logs in Microsoft Purview to track administrative actions.Centralize Log Storage- Consolidate logs from all cloud providers into a SIEM or CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) tool.- Example: Use Splunk or Elastic Stack to ingest and analyze logs from AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.Automate Alerts for Sensitive Changes- Configure alerts for high-risk actions, such as disabling logging or modifying IAM roles.- AWS Example: Use AWS Config rules to detect and notify changes to critical services.- Azure Example: Set up Azure Monitor alerts for write actions on sensitive resources.Enable Continuous Monitoring- Use tools like AWS Security Hub, Azure Defender, or Google Chronicle to continuously monitor cloud service modifications for anomalies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0025 |

Examples: - Azure Service Metadata: Metadata describing a resource in Azure, such as an Azure Storage Account or a Virtual Machine.- AWS Cloud Service Metadata: Metadata for an AWS EC2 instance collected using the `DescribeInstances` API call.- Google Cloud Service Metadata: Metadata for a Google Compute Engine instance collected using `gcloud compute instances describe`.- Office 365 Metadata: Metadata about an Office 365 SharePoint site.This data component can be collected through the following measures:Enable Cloud Metadata APIs- Leverage APIs provided by cloud providers to query metadata about services.    - AWS: Use AWS CLI or SDKs for `DescribeInstances`, `DescribeBuckets`, etc.    - Azure: Use `az resource list` or SDKs.    - Google Cloud: Use `gcloud compute instances describe` or related commands.    - Office 365: Use Microsoft Graph API.Centralize Metadata in a Security Platform- Aggregate metadata from multiple clouds into a SIEM or CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) tool.- Example: Integrate AWS CloudTrail with Splunk or Azure Monitor with Sentinel.Enable Continuous Monitoring- Set up automated jobs or workflows to regularly query and update metadata.- Example: Use AWS Config to track resource configurations and changes over time.Configure Access and Logging- Enable logging for API queries to ensure access and usage of metadata are monitored.- Example: Use AWS CloudTrail to log API activity for metadata queries.Use Cloud Security Tools- Employ CSPM tools like Prisma Cloud, Wiz, or Dome9 to gather metadata and identify misconfigurations.- Example: Prisma Cloud provides consolidated views of metadata for resources across AWS, Azure, and GCP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0025 |
| DS0025 | Cloud Service Enumeration            | Cloud service enumeration involves listing or querying available cloud services in a cloud control plane. This activity is often performed to identify resources such as virtual machines, storage buckets, compute clusters, or other services within a cloud environment. Examples include API calls like `AWS ECS ListServices`, `Azure ListAllResources`, or `Google Cloud ListInstances`. Examples: AWS Cloud Service Enumeration: The adversary gathers details about existing ECS services to identify opportunities for privilege escalation or exfiltration.- Azure Resource Enumeration: The adversary collects information about virtual machines, resource groups, and other Azure assets for reconnaissance purposes.- Google Cloud Resource Enumeration: The attacker seeks to map the environment and find misconfigured or underutilized resources for exploitation.- Office 365 Service Enumeration: The attacker may look for data repositories or collaboration tools to exfiltrate sensitive information.This data component can be collected through the following measures: Enable Cloud Activity Logging- Ensure cloud service logs are enabled for API calls and resource usage.- Example: Enable AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor, or Google Cloud Logging to track resource queries.Centralize Logs in a SIEM- Aggregate logs from cloud control planes into a centralized SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Azure Sentinel).- Example: Collect AWS CloudTrail logs and set up alerts for API calls related to service enumeration.Use Native Cloud Security Tools- Leverage cloud-native security solutions like AWS GuardDuty, Azure Defender, or Google Security Command Center.- Example: Use GuardDuty to detect anomalous API activity, such as ListServices being executed by an unknown user.Implement Network Flow Logging- Monitor and analyze VPC flow logs to identify lateral movement or enumeration activity.- Example: Inspect flow logs for unexpected traffic between compute instances and the cloud control plane.API Access Monitoring- Monitor API keys and tokens used for enumeration to identify misuse or compromise.- Example: Use AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault to manage and rotate keys securely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0025 |
| DS0025 | Cloud Service Disable                | This data component refers to monitoring actions that deactivate or stop a cloud service in a cloud control plane. Examples include disabling essential logging services like AWS CloudTrail (`StopLogging` API call), Microsoft Azure Monitor Logs, or Google Cloud's Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver). Disabling such services can hinder visibility into adversary activities within the cloud environment. Examples: - AWS CloudTrail StopLogging: This action stops logging of API activity for a particular trail, effectively reducing the monitoring and visibility of AWS resources and activities.- Microsoft Azure Monitor Logs: Disabling these logs hinders the organization’s ability to detect anomalous activities and trace malicious actions.- Google Cloud Logging: Disabling cloud logging removes visibility into resource activity, preventing monitoring of service access or configuration changes.- SaaS Applications: Stopping logging removes visibility into user activities, such as email access or file downloads, enabling undetected malicious behavior.This data component can be collected through the following measures:Enable and Monitor Cloud Service Logging- Ensure logging is enabled for all cloud services, including administrative actions like StopLogging.- Example: Use AWS Config to verify that CloudTrail is enabled and enforce logging as a compliance rule.API Monitoring- Use API monitoring tools to detect calls like StopLogging or equivalent service-stopping actions in other platforms.- Example: Monitor AWS CloudWatch for specific API events such as StopLogging and flag unauthorized users.SIEM Integration- Collect logs and events from the cloud control plane into a centralized SIEM for real-time analysis and correlation.- Example: Ingest AWS CloudTrail logs into Splunk or Azure Monitor logs into Sentinel.Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Tools- Leverage CSPM tools like Prisma Cloud, Dome9, or AWS Security Hub to detect misconfigurations or suspicious activity, such as disabled logging.- Example: Set alerts for changes to logging configurations in CSPM dashboards.Configure Alerts in Cloud Platforms- Create native alerts in cloud platforms to detect service stoppages.- Example: Configure an AWS CloudWatch alarm to trigger when StopLogging is invoked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0025 |

| DS0035 | Response Content                     | Captured network traffic that provides details about responses received during an internet scan. This data includes both protocol header values (e.g., HTTP status codes, IP headers, or DNS response codes) and response body content (e.g., HTML, JSON, or raw data).

| DS0037 | Certificate Registration             | Certificate Registration refers to the collection and analysis of information about digital certificates, including current, revoked, and expired certificates. Sources such as Certificate Transparency logs and other public resources provide visibility into certificates issued for specific domains or organizations. Monitoring certificate registrations can help identify potential misuse, such as unauthorized certificates or signs of adversary reconnaissance. Examples: - Certificate Transparency Logs: These logs record the issuance of SSL/TLS certificates by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).- Revoked Certificates: Information about certificates that have been invalidated before their expiration date.- Expired Certificates: Reports of expired certificates for a domain, which may indicate lax security practices or opportunities for adversaries to exploit expired credentials.- Domain Monitoring for Certificates: Maps SSL/TLS certificates to domains and subdomains, helping to identify any rogue certificates.- Public Certificate Directories: Services providing APIs to query issued certificates for analysis.This data component can be collected through the following measures:Use Certificate Transparency Monitors- Tools like crt.sh, CertStream, or APIs provided by certificate authorities (CAs) allow you to monitor issued certificates in real-time.- Example: Use CertStream to stream certificate issuance logs and filter for domains of interest.Analyze Certificate Revocation Sources- Monitor CRLs or query OCSP responders to detect revoked certificates.- Configure tools like OpenSSL or browsers to validate certificate revocation status automatically.Leverage Public Scanning Tools- Use tools such as SSL Labs, Censys, or Shodan to scan for certificate details related to your domain or network.Automate Certificate Monitoring- Set up automated scripts or services to parse Certificate Transparency logs for anomalies.- Example: Automate searches on crt.sh to identify certificates issued for typo-squatted domains.Integrate with Threat Intelligence- Enrich certificate data with threat intelligence feeds to detect connections to known adversary-controlled infrastructure.- Tools like VirusTotal can identify malicious certificates based on associated indicators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0037 |
| DS0038 | Passive DNS                          | "Domain Name: Passive DNS" captures logged historical and real-time domain name system (DNS) data.

| DS0038 | Domain Registration                  | "Domain Name: Domain Registration" data component captures information about the assignment, ownership, and metadata of domain names. This information is often sourced from registries like WHOIS and includes details such as registrant names, contact information, registration dates, expiration dates, and registrar details. This data is invaluable for tracking domain ownership, detecting malicious domain registrations, and identifying trends in adversary behavior. Examples: - Registrant Information: WHOIS lookup of example.com - Registration and Expiration Dates: A domain registered a week before being used in phishing attacks.- Domain Status: Status codes like clientTransferProhibited or serverHold indicate domain restrictions or potential hijacking activity.- Name Server Information: Name servers point to a public DNS provider often associated with malicious campaigns.- Privacy Protection: A domain uses WHOIS privacy protection to hide registrant details.This data component can be collected through the following measures:- WHOIS Services: Use tools or services to perform WHOIS lookups:- WHOIS APIs: Automate domain registration lookups with APIs:- Registrar Platforms: Directly query domain registrars (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap) for detailed registration data.- Threat Intelligence Platforms: Integrate domain registration data from services like Recorded Future, RiskIQ, or PassiveTotal for enriched analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0038 |

It serves as a critical resource for tracking active infrastructure and understanding the network footprint of an organization or adversary. Examples: - DNS Query Example: `nslookup example.com`, `dig example.com A`- PTR Record Example: `dig -x 192.168.1.1`- Tracking Malicious Domains: DNS logs reveal repeated queries to suspicious domains like malicious-site.com. The IPs resolved by these domains may be indicators of compromise (IOCs).- DNS Record Types    - A/AAAA Record: Maps domain names to IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6).    - CNAME Record: Canonical name records, often used for redirects.    - MX Record: Mail exchange records, used to route emails.    - TXT Record: Can include security information like SPF or DKIM policies.    - SOA Record: Start of authority record for domain management.    - NS Record: Lists authoritative name servers for the domain.This data component can be collected through the following measures:- System Utilities: Use built-in tools like `nslookup`, `dig`, or host on Linux, macOS, and Windows to perform active DNS queries.- DNS Logging    - Windows DNS Server: Enable DNS Analytical Logging to capture DNS queries and responses.    - Bind DNS: Enable query logging in the named.conf file.- Cloud Provider DNS Logging    - AWS Route 53: Enable query logging through CloudWatch or S3:    - Google Cloud DNS: Enable logging for Cloud DNS queries through Google Cloud Logging.- Network Traffic Monitoring: Use tools like Wireshark or Zeek to analyze DNS queries within network traffic.- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Integration: Aggregate DNS logs in a SIEM like Splunk to create alerts and monitor patterns.- Public OSINT Tools: Use OSINT platforms like VirusTotal, or PassiveTotal to collect information on domains and their associated IP addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0038 |
